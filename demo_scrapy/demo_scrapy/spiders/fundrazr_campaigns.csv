"1,100","We are starting this fundraiser for the Family of Michael
    Rardin. Kristina is so very busy with things at the hospital that
    she doesn’t have the time to set this up. She is however the manager
    of this fundraiser and is the ONLY person who will have access to
    the funds. As some of you may know, Michael was in an accident
    involving a bonfire. He is currently at University of Chicago
    Critical burn unit and has a very long way towards recovery. Several
    doctors have stated that Michael has burns on over 20% of his body.
    That includes both arms, his upper torso, as well as, his neck and
    all of his face. He is also going through acute respiratory distress
    due to the thermal injury to his lungs. He has already undergone 1
    of many surgeries to come, in order to place skin grafts over the
    open burns. They had to put everything on hold currently to put
    Michael on an echmo machine. This machine keeps his blood oxygenated
    since his lungs and the ventilator alone are not able to fully
    function the way his body needs. It also helps to keep his body
    within normal temperatures. His mother Kristina has had to take
    leave from work. And although she has some leave of absence, she
    does not get paid. Additionally, while she has insurance for
    Michael, there will be many more expenses that insurance may not
    cover, as well as, the expenses of traveling to Chicago daily and
    trying to make arrangements for Michael’s younger sister Ana on the
    days or evenings that Kristina will need to be there to support
    Michael. She has had to make all of the hard decisions for his
    recovery. We are asking for donations to help cover the above
    expenses, as well as, a little extra help so Kristina can still
    provide for things at home, since she will be out of work for a
    while. The doctors last stated he would be in the hospital at least
    6-8 weeks, Unfortunately, he still cannot have visitors outside of
    immediate family.Many people have been asking what they can do to help. .
    Currently we could use everyone’s help financially. Actually, Any
    help you can offer is greatly appreciated! Even $5 would help. We
    ask that you please share this fundraiser to help spread the word.
    Thank you all for being so concerned for Michael’s well-being. The
    amount of outward support has been overwhelming and greatly
    appreciated for this amazing young man. He is fighting so hard!
    Again, whatever you can give is appreciated. Thank you so much!SincerelyFamily and Friends of Michael Rardin.",Fundraiser for Michael Rardin,$,6,0,Days running,146,$150k,21,"Chicago, US",5,15,Kara Miller,1%,https://fundrazr.com/MichaelRardin

  help some of our best friends.Mitch and Katie Bennett along with their 4 children lost their
  houseand most of their possessions last night (May 22)in a vicious tornado that ripped through Eldon, MO.
  The tornado hit after the family had went to bed and it is only by the
  grace of God that they survived. They were not all able to make it to
  their safe room and Mitch was even tossed about in the house but not
  seriously injured. The garage wasfully destroyedalong with the entire south side of their house which is where their
  bedrooms are.It is our hope to raise funds that will aid them in the
  reconstruction and additional living expenses that will be faced in
  the coming weeks. Funds raised will go directly to Mitch and Katie's
  bank account. Please be aware that a 2.9% + $0.30 fee is accessed for
  all gifts given through Fundrazr. If you have any questions feel free

  for quite some time now. On the evening of May 19th, on her way home
  from work, she was hit on her motorcycle by a car. She was ambulanced
  to Harborview Hospital & had a 5 hour surgery the next mroning to
  repair her broken femur, fibula, ankle & disattached patella.
  Sadly, we believe her Kawasaki KLR 650 may also be totalled.She is currently recovery from surgery at the hospital & will
  most likely need to be off work for a couple months. If you know
  Shelley, this will NOT be an easy task! She likes to GO, GO, GO!!! She
  is constantly working, picking up extra shifts for folks at work,
  helping her friends out & socializing when & if time permits.All funds raised will be used to support Shelley's recovery, help pay
  her expenses while she's off work and to help cover medical expenses.
  We will update you of those expenses as they arise.Any contribution you can give to Shelley is GREATLY APPRECIATED!! She
  is an incredibly kind-hearted person & is constantly helping &
  giving to others. (Infact, ironically enough I can remember a very
  similar situation where a neighbor woman who is also a well-loved
  local bartender also had surgery on her leg & was off work for a
  few months about 2 years ago....Shelley, was terribly concerned about
  how she was going to be able to make it not working & made sure
  that she donated to help her out! Irony.....) We have no idea what her
  medical bills and expenses will be right now, so I'm just throwing a
  number out there. We will update it as we know more!We expect Shelley to make a FULL recovery & hopefully be back up
  on her bikes sooner than later! In the mean time, we need to keep her
  focused on healing & getting back to 100%!!!THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY & SUPPORT FOR HER!!!!
  If you know and are a friend of Shelley's you know exactly how she is
  & that she would be bending over backwards to do the same for you.
