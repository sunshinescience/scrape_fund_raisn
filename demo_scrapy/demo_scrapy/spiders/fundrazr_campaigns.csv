  over 2 years for a home of her own.  A couple of  years ago she
  finally  she found it a wonderful devoted dad  2 human brothers 4
  canine siblings  and couple feline siblings too. Antoinettes family
  has endured more than We can imagine  truly can’t even make this up.
  Believe me I ve  verified it all because seem to unbelievable.  
   Antoinette dad lost his job and after months found a new one but of
  course he is paid less.  Next The boys mother was tragically killed in
  a car accident upstate last year   Followed by their dad requiring 2
  heart surgeries  and now walking the dogs he stepped into a pothole
  and broke his leg    Antoinette found another job after the last one
  fired him because a fancy board member of building complained he was
  feeding and encouraging feral cats.  Undaunted he found another
  working for Stanley steamer  but while doing some yard work he
  literally cut his finger in half using an cement grinder.  Again
  unable to fulfill his job duties at work Raising 2 sons on his own  
  And minimal insurance coverage the Antoinette dad is struggling   to
   keep food on the table for all  pay bills and keep everything
  together    It’s bsck to school and the boys need supplies. Clothes etcHe is a wonderful dad and an amazing pet owner putting everyone
  ahead of himself.  Antoinette and her furry siblings are dogs nobody
  else wanted  because they aren’t  easy  if given to a shelter they
  won’t stand a chance They are actually difficult at times and many
  would have just given up on them but he won’t . Friends have told him
  to move  start again  find cheaper apartment. His response simply “ I
  can’t I have dogs no one but me loves or wants What would become of
  them.?  .  We are  hoping to help this family and raise enough funds
  to cover some of their bills  and expenses so they can regroup

Michelle N Kids,"Im strong willed and dont like asking for help. Ive been ridiculed
  for even asking for help in the past so I stopped. Ive tried to do it
  own my own. I have had so many road blocks and hurdles lately. I had a
  job but lost it but it was definitely not my fault.  Ive been job
  searching like crazy and no luck. I go to interviews and no one calls
  back, no one returns calls. I unfortunately have a record and Im
  trying to move forward and do  better. I need help with my electric
  and rent. I no longer have a car but Ill get that later. My focus is
  to get these two bills paid taken care of to get my kids home
  permanently to me! I need to get out of my moms and get back home.
  Turn the electric back on. Im sorry Im asking for help there is NO
  resource left. Ive tried several times.  Sat on the phone for hours
  nothing because Im not current on my electric bill. Ill prove that the
  bill has been paid same with rent each time. I will continue to pay it
  forward. Im sorry for even having to ask for help this totally sucks.
  I know not everyone can help not everyone wants to help..trust me I
  get it...but if you choose to I appreciate it and so do my kids in the
  long run. If you are reading this in Twitter my last name is different
  than my Facebook profile for a reason. Please feel free to message me

Cornerstone Fellowship Reach the City campaign!,"Cornerstone Fellowship of Mill Run is the same old church, but has a
  new passion & vision for reaching the lost in the city of Altoona,
  Pa & beyond. We are beginning to make a real impact, but before we
  can take that next step WE NEED YOUR HELP!Hi, I'm pastor Steve Olivieri of Cornerstone Fellowship of Mill
  Run. I NEED YOUR HELP! This small but growing church is has a passion,
  just like I do for reaching the lost, poor & needy with the gospel
  in the Altoona area.In order to take that next step we need to raise up to
  $1,500/month in financial support for up to 3 years, or until the
  church is large enough to support me as pastor full-time on it's own.Please prayerfully consider supporting the work God is doing
  through this church today! Here are just a few of the ways we're
  trying to reach the lost & needy with the love of Jesus Christ.1. ""The Story"" church campaign is a 31 week journey
  through the major stories of the Bible. The amazing thing about this
  journey is that people are seeing for the first time how the Bible
  fits together, from beginning to end, as one continuous story of how
  much God loves his people & the lengths He is willing to go to
  save them from sin.2. Our Awana Club is getting kids off the streets & teaching
  them the gospel in a fun and engaging way every Sunday night from
  6-8pm. For kids ages 2 through 7th grade.3. Reach the Community Campaign: We are in the midst of setting
  up a ""missions"" fund that will be used to help with physical
  as well as spiritual needs for the needy in the Altoona area.As always you are warmly invited to join us every Sunday

Please help me #keepmoving #outdoors with an #Alinker Walking Bike.,"Hi! I’m David. Please help me #keepmoving outdoors with an #Alinker
  Walking Bike. I'm a single Dad and would love to be able to enjoy the
  outdoors again with my daughter and friends.Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 2, I spent most of my
  youth in and out of a wheelchair and in and out of hospitals. After
  many years and total joint replacements in both hips and knees, I
  became more mobile and began participating in outdoor activities with
  the assistance of several local non-profit groups that assist the
  disabled in the participation of sports such as hiking, kayaking,
  sailing and more.However, in early 2018, I had to have a second knee replacement (on
  the same knee) and later that year, I fell and since then, I have not
  been able to walk without assistance.  I currently use crutches
  outside and a walker in the home.  I have not participated in any
  outdoor activities for over a year. I no longer go for walks, regular
  grocery shopping, go to malls or other public venues.  Walking with
  crutches while having Rheumatoid Arthritis causes added pain in my
  back, neck and shoulders.  This pain along with an overall fear of
  falling prevents me from going out, enjoying the great outdoors in New
  England and being socially active as I had been before the knee
  replacement and subsequent fall. I attend Physical Therapy several
  days a week and am trying to get some strength back.The #Alinker is a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people
  stay active and live life to the fullest allowing users experience
  chronic aches and pains, chronic illnesses and recovering from an
  injury, they can all still be active! Currently, Health Insurance
  plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility devices and that’s
  why campaigns like this are so important. I'd be able to rebuild and
  maintain muscle tone in my legs, be able to walk upright instead of
  using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall and once again
  enjoy my time outdoors and with family and friends without the feeling
  like I'm slowing everyone down. It may even allow me to return to
  scuba diving as I'd be able to use the #Alinker to walk the trail down
  to the water's edge at Ft. Wetherill park in Jamestown, RI.  to It
  really would give me so much freedom back, open up my world again, and
  change my life. To learn more about my life’s journey, please visit me

Detangled Star Spangled Ancestral Research Project,"Hello family,As you should know, I am Quincy LeNear Gossfield - your cousin. :)I began researching our family over 10 years ago as I began to wonder
  exactly who I was and where I come from. There were a lot of unknowns
  and a lot of erased history. As I began to explore, the more mysteries
  and roadblocks I began to encounter. As my research remained
  steadfast, many of those roadblocks were removed and opened up the
  pathways to learning of the many individuals and stories of our
  forefathers' and ancestors that we had never known before.Since then I have amassed an endless amount of information, records,
  photos, and more, and have become the de facto family historian. I
  administer multiple family member’s DNA accounts and family trees, and
  their participation has pushed this research beyond what I imagined
  was possible.I have found missing families, lines of the family splintered and
  forgotten, helped reunite adoptees to their birth families, discovered
  notable and famous relatives, found royalty, and connected with
  newfound cousins far and wide of all ethnicities and national backgrounds.I share all this information individually, across family sites, and
  on my Facebook BlogDetangled Star Spangled.However, to continue I need
  financial assistance. None of the research, testing, records or
  subscriptions are free and I have assumed the cost for 10 years.
  However, the goal of my work is to be able to continue to share this
  with everyone, with every family, but I simply need help to continue.MY COSTS1.Ancestry.com$200 a year2.

  mend the broken and missing branches of our families histories.$5, $10. $20, $50 or more spread across us all can help me

    rehearsal studios at the intersection of North Ave and Howard
    streets. Over the years, the festival has grown to include over 90
    bands, with 900+ people attending over 3 days.The arts community continues to recognize the value ofproviding a platform for lesser-known artists when a huge
      cross-over audience assemblesin the neighborhood for Artscape. The founders of Ratscape also
    feel a deepcommitment to holding a DIY, artist-lead eventin the Station North neighborhood, where rent is increasing and
    space for musicians is decreasing.After the Hour Haus closed, Ratscape moved to the Ynot Lot and
    became a free, public event,maximizing inclusivity and exposure to some of the best acts

    arts community. Musicians, illustrators and coordinators donate
    their time and talents, and then proceeds are split. In past years
    we relied on ticket sales, but as we move towards open source
    programming so more people can rock out, there's less $ for our

  three phases, telling a story about The Burning Man Experience.The installation opens with 100 life-sized human figures

  inspiration from the Terracotta Army of ancient China. Each artisan
  put his face on a statue generating individualism in sea conformity.Phase One:At a distance, they all look the same but once among them you
    can see that they are individual. This is achieved with the use of
    state-of-the-art point-cloud scanning and 3D printing technology
    through which each figure’s face will be made with a scan of a real
    person’s face or a combination of the scans of a group of people.
    The mesh created will then be 3D printed and molded onto each figure.Phase Two:Each body becomes a canvas, constructed
    of a hardened and sealed wax that will create a blank slate for
    artists and burners alike to transform with personal creativity and
    expression throughout the week. This is meant to reflect the week
    leading up to the burn when you are vandalized, altered, and
    stretched by the thoughts and intentions of others.Phase Three:Is the burn. For a moment everyone is
    transformed by a rare expression of impermanence. All these
    individuals are all the same again, drawn to this place by an open
    heart. This is revealed post-burn; transformed from figures with
    their own likeness and days of vandalism to a body of steel all the
    same, a heart is revealed to represent our shared humanity. As we

Help a Buddhist nun with her retreat and fire puja,"Being a monk or nun can be hard in the modern world. It is even
  tougher if you have a disability. There's worldly work to pay the
  bills, and spiritual work too,. Then there are health issues as well.The hardest job of all is a special counting retreat of more than
  100,000 prayers! This takes place every January at various Buddhist
  centers. A counting retreat is an amazing chance to deepen one's
  studies and understanding. It is also a wonderful chance to be part of
  a spiritual community full-time. .But the real world can often hold people back from achieving this goal.One of our dear Sangha is eager to do her counting retreat and fire
  puja so she can advance her practice and be of more benefit to all
  living beings. But travel and housing cost money, and the bills pile
  up while she is away. So we are turning to the many kind people who
  understand how important these practices are.  No amount is too small
  as she works on her mantra marathon and gets ready to attend an
  amazing fire puja at the end of all her efforts.Donations at certain levels will trigger little gifts kindly donated
  by our fundraising team, to benefit others even as we help our
    nun.Thank you for your great kindness and blessings!Note: We have been running this campaign since October, and
    would like to finish strong to help her with all the expenses. Many thanks!",Siobhan McNally,https://fundrazr.com/specialretreat,10%,$2.5k,$,255,0,days left,11,"New York, US",10,6,2,4

Support Me Keeping Safe in my Neighborhood,"I am a professional in the field of Education, a community
    builder, friend and good neighbor.  I am involved in the Independent
    Homeschool community, serve on our Water association board of
    directors, and teach mindfulness and local yoga classes for Special
    needs individuals.  I bought a home in a nice quiet neighborhood
    which seemed like the perfect place to live, walk dogs, ride horses,
    garden, and get to know my neighbors. Unfortunately, the past 2
    years have been incredibly difficult due to some personal losses and
    increased risk to my safety stemming from one of my neighbors.My neighbor, who moved with his family, to my neighborhood 2
    years ago, has been arrested many times and has a long history of
    stalking, harboring loaded and stolen weapons, sales and consumption
    of meth, Gang related activity, and child endangerment.  He was
    arrested on these same charges in 2014 while living 2 streets below
    me in the same neighborhood. Then, two years ago he became a tenant
    in the house across the street from me.At first he made an effort to be a good neighbor--saying “Hello”
    and helping out in the community. After a few months he became
    increasingly paranoid, defensive and angry. He became disgruntled
    and angry with me and other members of the local water association
    when he couldn’t get his way and then he  set out with clear
    malicious intent to destroy my reputation and my livelihood by
    repeatedly harassing, stalking and threatening me.During the last year and a half he:Used gun hand signals to shoot at  me.Threatened my life.Watched/stalked me in person and with video surveillance.
       These videos came up during this process and in court showing me
      on my property. He made it known in some of the videos that he
      knows when I leave my property, change my clothes and shower.Drive so close to me when I walk my dogs that I have to jump
      in a ditch to get away. This caused me to fall and get hurt.Stated he wished I would die from a surgery I had last year.Threatened to hurt me and those who I serve on the board of
      directors with.Yells obscenities at me and others.When I asked him to keep his dogs quieter or stop shining
      lights at my house, he was aggressive and threatened to “get me
      and take me down”In May I was  served with a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO),
    from him,  stating that I harass and stalk him. He used it to harass
    me by getting in my way and then calling the local sheriff saying I
    violated the TRO.  He used the TRO as a tool to further harass me
    and to try and get me arrested.From all of this my vigilance increased.   I endured fear,
    anxiety, loss of sleep ,and nightmares. At one point I felt I had to
    leave town because I was scared of being watched and stalked by him.
     It is creepy to know someone is watching me all the time and I do
    not know what he is capable of. I have fear of being shot dead by him.Right away my attorney found out his background and had me serve
    him with a TRO so I am protected. He avoided service for almost a
    month. We finally used a Private Investigator to serve him with the
    legal paperwork.Why I need help:After 6 months and 3 court continuances I  finally won my TRO
    against my neighbor and the judge ruled against his TRO. I  now have
    a Restraining Order against my neighbor for the next 18 months. This
    is very good news!And, if that is not enough I have to deal with a
    corrupt Sheriff Commander, who sided with my neighbor, accusing me
    of lying. Then he lied about the situation in an official court
    document! Please help me obtain Justice, Peace and Safety!Good News:  My attorney and I have filed a complaint
     with Internal affairs at the Local Sheriff's office against the
    Sheriff's Commander!The issue, at hand, is that I can not afford to pay the legal
    fees associated with the legal process of fighting against my
    neighbor’s TRO against me as well as pursuing a TRO against him. I
    took out a loan which is now maxed out, I have use up my savings,
     my credit card is maxed out and there is till a balance owed to my
    attorney. I am in quite a bit of debt now and I am not able to pay
    my bills.How you can help:Please help me pay my legal fees!  I do not have the funds to
    cover the accumulated costs.**Thank you from the bottom of my heart for any support you can

Please Help me go see SHINee in Dallas.,"When it comes to personal fundraising I try to stay away from
    things that aren't Health and Emergency related. It's been a hard
    year for me, however a small beacon of happiness emerged in my life
    and that was SHINee. I have depression and BPD but rediscovering
    SHINee, and most particularly their music has been incredibly
    uplifting for me. It's been 8 years since their debut but they're
    finally coming to North America for a few concerts and the closest
    one to me is Dallas. I was incredibly excited ago, especially since
    it is tax return season and once I would recieve my check from the
    IRS I would be able to cover my whole trip. But unfortunately I was
    sent an email from the IRS stating that because of how my taxes were
    filed, a new law required my tax return to be delayed. So it's hard
    swallowing my pride but I could really use your help, no matter how
    big or small it would be appreciated. If you are someone who follows
    my channel on youtube I would be able to fulfill special request
    videos for you, if you're a local friend who needs help with
    something, whether it's sewing a costume, cleaning your car, or
    walking your dog I'd be happy to. The lowest goal for my campaign is
    100 dollars as this would cover the cheapest ticket (with fees and
    such) and any extra paypal fees. The most expensive ticket is 215
    dollars but I am not shooting for that, I would be grateful for
    anything and tbqh getting to see SHINee, even in the nosebleed

Please help Hannah to travel and see WCPW live.,"Hello, my name is Hannah and I need help achieving a dream.On the internet, you can recognize me as ""Hannah Bee"", with
  the Twitter handle@GraciasToGracie. In real life
  though, I am a practicing Radiologic Technologist based from the Philippines.WCPW means so much to me as it helps me get over the stresses that
  the Medical profession brings. I have made a lot of close friends
  through the promotion! In turn, I have also made a lot of fanworks for
  the promotion, both serious and light-hearted in nature.It's my dream to see and experience WCPW live. I picked the March
  tapings to aim to go to as it'll be my 21st birthday on March 23, and
  it'll be a hell of a way to celebrate it!The only thing that's hindering me would be the costs to fly to
  London. My salary is not enough for me to save up for a flight. Also,
  I am too young to get a loan. I have no options left for me to try on,
  except this one.The money will be used to fund my flight to the UK for the Loaded
  tapings on London. They will be held on March 13, 2017, 7 PM GMT, on
    theCoronet Theatre. Not only will I go to see quality
    professional wrestling, I will also get a chance to meet other fans
    and friends I have made through the internet for the past year!Every bit counts. A contribution and/or a share helps me a lot to
  achieve my dream. Thank you very much in advance!IMPORTANT NOTE:-IF IN ANY CASE THE FLIGHT DOES NOT COME INTO FRUTITION, I
    WILL BE DONATING EVERY CENT TOKYTHE FOUNDATION, INC.Kythe is a non-profit, non-stock organization aimed towards
    improving the quality of life among hospitalized children with
    cancer and other chronic illness.FAQ1. Why can't you finance it yourself?- Working as a radiographer in the Philippines isn't as rewarding
  unlike in other countries. My weekly salary is just ~£23, and that's
  still up for tax deduction!2. Why can't you turn to other people for help?- Unfortunately, I have not much options to ask help from. We all
  know how non-wrestling fans view all of this, then intensify that with
  the culture we have around here. I think that the fans are the best
  people who can understand how much important this will be for me.
  Friends have convinced me to try crowd funding out, since I have
  nothing to lose at this point.3. What makes you worth it?- I don't know, to be honest. I'm just a fan who got impacted a lot
  with what they do on and off the camera.Basically, they have brought my smile back during a really dark time
  in my life. They also inspired me to finish through everything, from
  the last months of my medical training to my licensure examinations. I
  have also met great friends through them!In turn, I have made a lot of fan works for them, both serious and
  light-hearted. Never did I expect that all of these will have
  something in return, really. Unlike how some view it, I did them to
  show appreciation and love, no dark master plan shenanigans.4. Do you need $1,500? Really?- I was just being transparent of the costs of the flight. It does
  not necessarily mean I need to get $1,500 from you all.  I'm still
  trying all my best to save up!5. Why can't you share it on FB?- Crowd funding is greatly frowned upon in our culture, and I'm
  really not keen on having personal conflict with family, friends, and
  colleagues. I feel that I will just be misunderstood, so I'm trying to
  keep this under the rug. Although, when I DO get to fly, I'd gladly
  tell them about all the awesome people who helped me!6. What other things can you do?- I used to take commissions, but I stopped since work takes up most
  of the time. Although if you really want to, just ask me! We might
  work something out.7. After flying to London... now what?- I plan to make a little video documenting my journey! Of course,

Spende für unser Studium in Bethel,"(English below)Hey Ihr Lieben,seit Anfang September 2015 besuchen wir die „Bethel School of
  Supernatural Ministry” („Schule des übernatürlichen Dienstes”) in
  Redding, Kalifornien. Wir lernen in diesem Studium wichtige
  Hintergründe und Skills zur Auslegung der Bibel, und werden darin
  trainiert ein Leben im Übernatürlichen zu führen, das heißt das
  Übernatürliche zu erwarten und freizusetzen (übernatürliche Heilung
  von Krankheiten, Prophetisches Reden, Worte der Erkenntnis, etc.), so
  wie es Jesus uns vorgelebt hat. Ein wichtiger Leitsatz, den wir hier
  haben, ist „Wie im Himmel, so auf Erden“, das heißt, den himmlischen
  Standard auf die Erde zu bringen. Ebenso lernen wir mehr und mehr
  unsere Identität als Söhne und Töchter Gottes auszuleben, und ganz
  praktisch Gottes Liebe für die Menschen im Alltag weiterzugeben, zum
  Beispiel durch Evangelisation und verschiedene Dienste für die Stadt
  Redding (Obdachlose beschenken, Angebote für Kinder, Säuberung von
  Parkanlagen).Unser Visum für die USA enthält leider keine
  Arbeitserlaubnis, so dass wir zum Leben (Miete, Auto, Lebensmittel)
  und für unseren Missionseinsatz in Los Angeles auf Eure Spenden
  angewiesen sind (mehr Infos zum Missionseinsatz „Azusa Now“ findet ihr
  unterhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylS05Cu60Y).Wir freuen uns sehr und sind dankbar über jedes Gebet und jede
  finanzielle Unterstützung für unser Studium:-)In Liebe,Sören und Mi-SoWeitere Informationen zum Studium erhaltet Ihr unter:http://bssm.net/Hey Guys,since September 2015 we are students in Bethel School of Supernatural
  Ministries (BSSM) in Redding, California. On a biblical foundation we
  learn how to live a life in the supernatural, that means to expect and
  release supernatural healing, share prophetic words and words of
  knowledge, etc., just like Jesus did. „On earth as it is in heaven“ is
  our goal and passion. Furthermore we learn to live in our identity as
  sons and daughters in Christ, and to love people in a practical way
  (e.g. share the gospel, serve the homeless, program for kids, clean
  the city).Unfortunately, due to our visa we are not allowed to take up a job in
  the USA. So, we have to rely on your kindness and accept donations for
  our living (food, car, rent) and for our missiontrip to Los Angeles in

AOII Bike Race Fund-- Racing to the Top!,"I think most of you know me, but I'm Sam (Smith) Buente and I'm an
  AOII Chi Lambda alumna and currently the administration adviser. As
  such, I have learned that we are woefully behind in our Bike Race
  training gear. Although women who participate have been willing to
  shell out their own money for proper equipment and such, we are at a
  point where we need to seriously reconsider the safety of our existing
  equipment. This gets pricey. We requested to use a pot of money
  available through AOII headquarters, but were told that would not be
  an option, so we're turning to alumnae for help. Here's the budget breakdown:4 new bikes at $400 each= $16002 new sets of spinners at $100 each= $200Estimated repairs to make existing bikes safe for additional team
  members= $500Goal: $2300I know this is a lot of money, but I also know that we can raise
  this. We are proud group of women with a history of being competitive.
  AOII won Bike Race in 2014, and some of those team members are still
  around to lead us to victory in 2016, but we can't do it without
  better, safer equipment. Please spread the word, and give whatever you can.Donations will go directly to my Paypal account and I will write a

Voice of Christians from Galilee,"INVITATION:We welcome You to join our efforts in supporting Christians in the
  HolyLand!Our goals express the following points:promoting christian values;initiating and supporting projects aiming at defending christians
    wherever persecuted in the world;supporting christian communities in the Holy Land by the means of
    finances and formation;promoting trips to the Holy Land and deepening our knowledge of
    the christian sites;creating awareness of our christian roots and heritage as well as
    the need for responsibility for each other.Olive Trees– Sign of Peace and HopeOlive leaf– symbol of Peace and HopeFew points to describe the significance of olive roots:the whole human family is like a tree, many branches seemingly
    spreading into many different directions and yet the whole tree held
    together by its roots. we are all rooted in the same God's act of Creation;as one human family we should learn how to experience our
    brotherhood in a more tangible way, but in order to feel for each
    other, first we need to realise our common human condition;as christians we understand that our spiritual roots will bring us
    back to the place from where christianity has originated;olive tree is a symbol of strength and endurance, seemingly small
    and insignificant and yet strong enough to withstand even the
    wildest storms;olive tree is also meant to bear fruit, its oil has been used for
    various very significant purposes: people use it for the food, light
    and medicine, oil used to serve for annointing kings and prophets,
    it is still being used during the first and the most important
    Sacrament of Baptism;olive leaf used to symbolise peace and reconcilation, symbol
    traced back to the time of Noah when after a Flood a dove had been
    sent to check if the earth is already at peace and suitable to
    receive its inhabitans again;finaly, for us christians the olive garden will always bring to
    mind the last hours of Jesus praying before his passion and also the
    olive wood became the tool of our salvation since the cross on which
    Jesus has paid for our sins has been made of olive wood.The adopted tree will receive the name of the person adopting it and
  in this symbolical way you have your roots in the Holy Land which bear
  fruit. It is an encouragement and reminder for us believers that we
  can never take our faith for granted.HOW TO JOIN THE PROJECT:""Adopting"" an olive tree entitles you to a few benefits.
  You will receive the picture of your olive tree with your name placed
  over there, a bottle of virgin olive oil (750 ml), and small souvenir

  christian identity""Christians living in Galilee are offering their gardens as a place to
  discover daily lives of local communities there.  The invitation
  provides the opportunity for organising various trips for youth and
  adults with the itinerary and programme adjusted to the needs of a
  particular group.  The goal of retreat trips is also to widen the
  horizons of understanding christian traditions, especialy the
  beautiful eastern rites.  We would like to cooperate with the best
  guides in the Holy Land as well as with the local priests in order to
  provide time for prayer and reflection but also to create an
  opportunity for sharing testimony and getting to know each other in a
  deeper way.  Our christian friends in Galilee are open to receive
  groups of youth who would be willing to experience a christian camp in
  the midst of the fields and olive gardens in the heart of Galilee.CONTACT:OLIVE ROOTS ASSOCIATION ISRAEL OFFICEEmail: hane.hm@gmail.comPhone: +972-54-783-6115 (I'm on WhatsApp)DEIR HANNADeir Hanna is a local council in the North District of Israel,
    located on the hills of the Lower Galilee, 23 kilometres (14 mi)
    southeast of Acre. At the end of 2005, the town had a population of
    8,500 approximately 80% of them being Muslims and the remaining 20%
    being Christian.In the 2nd to 4th centuries, the Jewish village of Kfar Yohanna
    (כפר יוחנה) was known in as the seat of the Cohens of Yakhin, the
    21st of the 24 Priestly Courses or Priestly Watches (משמרות הכהונה).According to one source, in the Crusader times Deir Hanna was a
    fief known as ""Ber Henne"", belonging to Phillipe le Rous.
    However, according to Petersen, there are no traces of Crusader
    occupation in the village. Deir Hanna was a base for the az-Zaydānī
    -family, and as such increased greatly in importance with Dhaher
    al-Omar rise to power in the 18th century.In the late 19th century, it was described as: ""High walls
    all around the village, which is built of stone. The walls have
    round towers, and were built by Dhaher el Amrs son, Sad el Amr. It
    is situated on the top of a high ridge, and contains about 400
    Christians. It is surrounded by olive-groves and arable land. Water
    is obtained from cisterns and an old paved birkeh to the north of
    the village.""At the time of the 1931 census, Deir Hanna had 117 occupied
    houses and a population of 427 Muslims and 136 Christians. In 1945,
    it had 750 Arab inhabitants, who owned a total of owned 15,350
    dunams of land.During Operation Hiram, 29-31 October 1948, the town surrendered
    to the advancing Israeli army. Many of the inhabitants fled north
    but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers. Deir
    Hanna remained under Martial Law until 1966.The town has been through a thorough modernization process in the
    last 10 years, and now has a full education system, health care
    facilities and sports playgrounds. Deir Hanna forms the Land Day

Help Ralph and Twyla deliver clean water!,"Ralph and Twyla Williams are going to Tanzania to work with the
  church in Monduli, in the Arusha Region. We are spreading the good
  news of Jesus Christ and helping the people of the Monduli region in
  His name.Leaders in the Monduli community point out two major needs in the area:1) The community needs a good supply of clean water for every home.
  Today, most people carry water from a pond where they also water their
  animals. Depending on the time of year, there may be a pond a mile or
  so away, or they may have to walk several miles each way for water.
  The water they get is dirty, and carries diseases, but it's all they have.2) There are many illiterate adults, who would like to learn to read.
  This affects their own future, as well as their children, and the
  economy of the area.We looked for ways to meet these needs using available materials and
  technology. Using sustainable methods, we can enable people to meet
  their own needs. While we teach them, we build relationships and
  spread the gospel of Christ.The money we raise will be used to supply equipment and teaching
  materials for rainwater collection and bio-sand water filters. We will
  use these to teach people to supply clean water for their own homes,
  and to teach them to teach others.We are also developing a sustainable Adult Literacy Program,
  training volunteers within the community to use the Bible as well as
  other readily available materials to teach their neighbors to read.
  This program will give us an audience for discussions about Jesus and
  the Bible, and will be a blessing to the community.We need help getting started! We must set up demonstration systems
  and purchase tools in order to be able to teach.Our church is also accepting donations in our name. If you want a
  receipt for tax purposes, please send your check to COCWS, 1106

HELP SEND KATHY TO SPEAK AT THE 'DEMAND FREE SPEECH' RALLY IN D.C.,"Hi, My name is Kathy Shell-Amidon and I live in the U.S.A. and today,
  find myself asking for your support, help and donation gifts so I can
  'Let My Voice Be Heard' as a speaker at the'Defend Free Speech Rally'in Washington D.C.
  July 6, 2019. Event Trip July 4-6My invitation to speak at the rally in D.C. has been on rather
  short notice but is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that I make it to that rally
  but now realize, the shared room expenses, VIP Event, food etc.. will
  cost around $800.00 -$1000.00 dollars. I pray like minded friends,
  patriots, philanthropist and Christians will lend a hand and help me
  make it to the very important 'Demand Free Speech' Rally.  FREE SPEECH
  IS A THREAT TO ALL OF US and social media tech giants should NOT be
  allowed to control what we do or say online just because they
  disagree.MY STORY:I was the co-founder of a young, small but very accomplished
  conservative activist team in 2013-2015. My group strategist/ founder
  and I were suspended multiple times on and by Twitter to keep us from
  being able to work as a group.WHY DID OUR TEAM GET SUSPENDED, CENSORED AND ATTACKED ON AND BY
  TWITTER IN 2013-2015?ALL WE DID WAS WORK AS A GRASSROOTS GROUP TO TWEET TO OUR GOP
  HOUSE REPS asking them to co-sponsor H.Res 36, the bill that created
  the Benghazi Select Committee and helping the now retired GOP
  Congressman Frank Wolf, author of the bill get co-sponsors. TWITTER
  SHUT US DOWN**Click here to:See our 3 Thank You letters to our
  teamWe continued and was successful but not without a
  virtual war fight on our hands. We also helped another GOP Rep gain
  co-sponsor support for his bill, H.Res. 442 and later tried to help a
  3rd Rep but by then, Twitter had censored us completely, now known as 'shadowbanning'FAST FORWARD: My partner, being a Christian on the movie &
  TV industry decided he could create much needed 3D Christian motion
  pictures and on a micro budget but neither Twitter or Facebook will
  allow our promotions, links to the website or crowdfunders to be seen
  at all; forget getting a large fan base following when your movie
  project is invisible online. THE BATTLE AND STRUGGLE IS REAL!NOTE: NINETY PERCENT OF FUNDS RAISED OVER this goal needed for
  my D.C. rally  trip expenses will go to my group founder/partner &
  experienced motion picture & TV friend so he can continue creating
  the very first, live action 3D Christian motion picture (he has
  several more after the first one) to keep his movie project going.  We
  have been a team for the past 7 1/2 years and have suffered greatly
  because of our conservative work. The censorship on social media has
  slowed things down drastically and costing us both everything,
  threatening the motion pictures to reach millennial's for Christ.Please give generously today and HELP US fight the censorship of
  Twitter & Facebook....#1-By helping  me get to the Demand Free Speech Rally#2-
  Save the 3D Christian 'Orbiter' movie project( seeorbitermovie.comandroslerstudios.com) IF YOU  HAVE QUESTIONS OR

  respond within 24 hours.#3 PLEASE SIGN David Rosler's Disbar The Lawyers of Facebook and

  Home of the Brave' , the Country I grew up in, with First Amendment
  Rights set in stone by the founders of this great Nation would be
  under attack in the way that it is today.I have personally been involved in this Free Speech battle since
  2013 to current date. It has been the most devastating and costly time
  of my life because Twitter and Facebook aka the 'Axis of Evil' have
  made me, my group leader; our new Christian movie projects totally
  invisible online so we can not function as the left does and costing
  us everything. IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO see the cost of our political
  activism in 2013-2015 and what it would cost us personally, which has
  been everything, I DOUBT I would have entered into this fight, but I
  AM in this fight and refuse to back down because NOW they are messing
  with my our new 3D Christian motion picture project , livelihoods and
  continue to try to silence us and we have suffered the cost severly
  and I believe in free speech and not totalitarianism. I passionately
  believe in what the Constitution of the United States stands for in
  protecting our Free Speech! NOW, Please help me go to D.C. and make
  the case. PLEASE HELP GET ME THERE AND GET MY VOICE BACK ON THIS VERY
  IMPORTANT ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH!The 'Demand Free Speech' rally in D.C. July the 6th gives me my
  voice back and hopefully will help change things, bring the
  seriousness of this issue to President Trump and make MY VOICE COUNT
  with the others speaking there.You see; I was one of the first in 2013 - 2015 suspended
  multiple times, my group founder suspended, censored, shadow banned
  and attacked by Twitter and then Facebook to stop our Christian ,
  conservative activism and work. We had NO IDEA back then it would
  STILL be costing us everything TO THIS DAYI AM ASKING EACH OF YOU, PLEASE HELP ANY DONATION GIFT YOU CAN

"A Christmas miracle for Josh, Robyn, and Ceccelia","I feel very fortunate to have met Josh, Robyn, and little Cece about
  eight months ago. They had just moved in with my neighbors and were

  and loyal to the people that he loves.I constantly tell Robyn what an awesome mama she is. She is raising
  Cece with the best morals and values! The exact same that she has. She
  is extremely caring, honest, and the type of person that would give
  the shirt on her own back to someone less fortunate if she had to. She
  is also beyond brave for overcoming her past and I am so proud of her!
  I just love this woman! I really look up to her in many ways.Cece is the sweetest little girl that you would ever meet. Anyone
  that does get the chance to meet her just falls in love with her! She
  has a bubbly personality that makes your cheek muscles hurt from smiling!For reasons that I don't understand, earlier this week my neighbors
  gave Josh and Robyn until January 1st to move out. They do not have
  family nearby that they can both move in with, and even though Josh
  has a full-time job, they do not have the funds saved up to be able to
  put a down payment on an apartment or any other type of housing with
  such short notice. We have contacted every single resource in the area
  requesting help however there just aren't the funds available.On the bright side, a very dear friend of mine has an older truck for
  sale that she is willing to not only drastically lower the price of,
  but allow Josh to make payments on even after she signs it over to
  him. This would at least allow him to be able to get to and from work
  from wherever they end up living.Josh and Robyn are both optimistic about life and have lots of plans
  for their futures. They have both overcome some major obstacles and
  yet they remain positive. Please consider helping these two out by
  donating money that will go towards the purchase of the truck and to
  secure immediate housing! If you are unable to donate, sharing the
  post is just as considerate!Thank you so much!!Josh and Robyn's ""big sister"" Kristi",Kristi Leppla,https://fundrazr.com/Christmasmiracle,3%,$3k,$,100,40,Weeks running,3,"Farmington Hills, MI, US",12,22,17,5
IIEE - Change the Face,"Dear IIEE Alumni, I have recently been approached by one of my class fellows, and he brought this to my attention that at IIEE, an initiative named ""Change the Face"" has been taken up. And the entire purpose of this initiative is to increase the image and perception of IIEE in the outside world; global academia, industry and general public.In order to achieve the said objective, the plan is to start from IIEE website (www.iiee.edu.pk), and increase IIEE web presence by completely renovating and re-structuring the IIEE website. The website needs to be rebuilt in a manner that it can be compared with the leading engineering schools & universities across the globe. This plan of renovating, restructuring, rebuilding and maintaing the IIEE website includes getting services of professional web designers and professional photographers to get a worthy output.So, ""IIEE - Change the Face"" intiative requires support from Alumni from both financial and execution aspects. Total cost of this phase of initiative is estimated to be around USD $2000. Out of which $600 has already been raised. We need $1400 more to complete the target of $2000.  I will be adding the complete cost breakdown shortly. And that will expalin how the target amount of $2000 will be used. Some of the alumni who have already donated/contributed are as fellows:Zuhaib Hayat (batch 11), Faraz Husain (batch 13), Tahir N. Kurawarwala (batch 13), Umer Zeb (batch 13) and Jawwad Akhtar joji (batch 14) From the execution point of view, Ashab Mirza, Sajid Sahb and a couple of current students [Nasir Jumani (20th batch, final year) and Zaid Pirwani (21st batch, third year)] are active.The money that I will be collecting for this initiative, I will ultimately send that money to Khalil Sultan, who has been leading this initiative from financial point of view. And Khalil will hand over the money to the right individuals there in IIEE.I am going to wirte the contact details for myself and for Khalil Sutan. Please feel free to contact either myself or Khalil for any questions or concerns you might have.Zia ZaidiCell: +1 (408) 648 6029Email: szia_zaidi@hotmail.comKhalil SultanCell: +92-321-3748449Email: khalilsultan@yahoo.com Thanks,Regards,Zia Zaidi",Syed Zia Zaidi,https://fundrazr.com/2NZx4,22%,$2k,$,440,6,Years running,5,,10,30,20,1

Help me publish a book about the Kingdom of God!,"Who am I?Joshua S. Hopping is an ordained Vineyard pastor who over the
    past thirteen years has been been involved in the Vineyard Movement
    at local, national and international levels. He graduated from
    Vineyard Leadership Institute in 2007 and is currently pursuing a
    Master of Ministry degree through St. Stephen’s University in St.
    Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada. Joshua is an avid blogger at“WildGooseChase.org”where he posts book
    reviews, life thoughts and whatever else he finds interesting.What am I doing?I’m raising funds to publish a book that will help the average
    Jesus follower understand the central message of Jesus as recorded
    by all four gospel writers, namely that the kingdom of God has come,
    is coming, will be coming soon, and is delayed (i.e. Kingdom
    Theology). To be true to the Scriptures, we have to hold all four of
    these items in tension while understanding the cultural and
    historical background of the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.Split into two parts, the first half of the book explores the
    biblical concept of the kingdom of God throughout the Old and New
    Testaments. The second half builds upon this theological framework
    by applying the concept of Kingdom Theology to the different areas
    of our lives as learning for learning's sake is useless.The working title for the book isThe Here and Not Yet: What is Kingdom Theology and why does it
    matter?The full table of content is posted at the bottom of this
    listing for those who want to know more about the topics covered in
    the book.Recommendations for the Book“What I love about Josh's book is the way he melds powerful
      truth with an easy reading style. This makes the theology
      accessible to all without losing any of the impact of what it
      means to live ‘in the now, but not yet’. Historical truth,
      accurate theology and practical application makes this a handbook
      for people who want to ""do"" Christianity.” -Kevin
    Thienes, Pastor of Prayer Ministries, Vineyard Christian Fellowship
    of Boise""Josh'sThe Here and Not Yetis an absolutely
      outstanding work on the theology of the kingdom and corresponding
      practices. Not only does he lay the necessary biblical-theological
      framework, Josh demonstrates how the kingdom applies in every area
      of life. I highly recommend this to fellow pastors and churches
      alike!""-Luke T. Geraty (Th.B, M.Div., M.A.), Lead
    Pastor of the Red Bluff Vineyard ChurchIn addition to the above, Dr Peter Fitch, Dr Derek Morphew, and
    Dr Winn Griffin along with a few others have all read early drafts
    of this book and provided thoughtful feedback. The book has been
    edited by Judy Twycross, who worked on Doug Erickson’s bookLiving the Futureas well as books by Dr Derek Morphew, Alexander Venter and Costa Mitchell.Why am I doing this?Thirteen years ago I was introduced to Kingdom Theology through
    the Vineyard Boise (Idaho). As I learned about and embraced the
    tension of living in the here and not yet of the kingdom of God, my
    life was radically changed. I had found a theological framework that
    allowed for the mystery of God while providing answers to some of
    the hard questions of life.As I dove deeper into the realm of Kingdom Theology, I wanted
    share my discoveries with my friends and the people in my church.
    However I had a hard time finding anything that I could give to
    people that would fully explain the kingdom of God. I found thick
    scholarly books full of very technical theological terms. Or books
    about a specific topic (i.e. healing, prophecy, etc.) that used
    Kingdom Theology as an underlying framework but really didn’t
    provide an overview of the concept.I also discovered that the term “Kingdom Theology” was being
    used by different people from various backgrounds to mean almost
    anything. The Pentecostal/Charismatic crowd used it to talk about
    signs and wonders while a new breed of Evangelicals used it to talk
    about social justice. Still others used the term to describe the
    church – local or global – while still others used it to talk about
    Jesus’ Second Coming.No matter how many books I read, I couldn’t find a single volume
    that retained the tension of the here and not yet while explaining
    how Kingdom Theology affects our daily lives that could be read and
    understood by the average person sitting in church. Seeing that I
    couldn’t find it, I decided to write the evasive book myself.In financially helping publish this book,The Here and Not Yet: What is Kingdom Theology and why does it matter?, you are helping release a resource that will help hundreds, if
    not thousands, of people understand the kingdom message of Jesus. As
    you can see from the above recommendation, the book is written in a
    conversational style that is easy to read so that the average church
    member can pick it up and enjoy learning about Kingdom Theology.How you can help?Being a first time author, I have to cover a lot of the expenses
    myself even though my book,The Here and Not Yet, has been accepted for publication through Vineyard
    International Publishing (Cape Town, South Africa). This is where
    you all come in as I need help generating the necessary funds to pay
    for the book editing, layout, and cover design. A breakdown of the
    cost is listed below:Editing cost: $1,300Page layout: $450Cover design: $350Total: $2,100You can also support the publication of the book by buying a
    handcrafted magnetic locking book safe through myEtsy.com store.What do I receive for my donation?For those who financially support this endeavor, I will
    be exclusively releasing a PDF version of the book manuscript along withtwo essays that did not make it into the final version of the
    book along with two others previously published on my website. All
    the essays will be released in a PDF format. Details about these
    essays can be found below.“The Lord’s Prayer”Now most of us don’t think about the
  “Lord’s Prayer” as something to help us through the in-between times
  of the Kingdom. For most of us, it is just a nice poetic prayer that
  we hang on our walls, pray before football games or just recite in a
  flippant manner when someone ask us to pray. A look through history
  tells a different story as this prayer was the marker for those who
  truly gave their lives to follow Jesus. Even when everything else
  changed – cultures, tradition, Christian sub-group, etc. – the
  followers of Jesus have always kept this prayer close to their hearts,
  even when they really didn’t understand why they held on to it.
  However, if one looks at this prayer through the lens of Kingdom
  Theology – through the lens of the here and not yet of the two peaks
  of the kingdom – well, everything changes and the prayer takes on a
  whole new meaning.Note that a version of this essay
  appeared on my website in February 2015.“Kingdom Theology Resources”In my journey to learn more about
  Kingdom Theology, I’ve read over 100 books on the subject. Knowing
  that not everyone has the time or interest in reading that many books,
  I have created a list of the 25 plus Kingdom Theology books along with
  a short review of each of them. The resource is divided into two
  sections with the first section dealing with the theological
  foundation of Kingdom Theology. The second section contain those books
  whose focus in the practical application of Kingdom Theology (e.g.
  healing, miracles, environmental stewardship, social justice/human
  rights, etc.).Note that a version of this resource
  appeared on my website in September 2015.“The Calling Out Of A People”Abraham is one of the key figures in
  Scriptures with all followers of Jesus being called “children of
  Abraham.” This previously unpublished essay dives into the call of
  Abraham by the Creator King of heaven and earth as recording in
  Genesis 12 and 15. Portions of this essay are included in the final
  version of my book; however the full multiple page essays did not make
  it into the book due to space limitations.“The War of the Ten Plagues”The people of the Ancient Near East
  (i.e. the Egyptians and Israelites) typically believed that the world
  around them was controlled by the gods of the land. Life revolved
  around gods – one was either appeasing the gods, asking permission of
  the gods, or receiving punishment from the gods. Seen against this
  background of polytheism, the Exodus story takes on a new light. It
  becomes less of an elaborated rescue attempt and more of a war with
  each of the ten plagues as a battle between the God of the Hebrews and
  the gods of the Egyptians. Or, more specifically, it was a power
  encounter between the High King of the universe and the
  self-proclaimed king of the earth and the forces of darkness. In this
  exclusive previously unpublished essay, I try to connect each plague
  with the gods and goddess of Egypt to understand more about the war
  between the Creator King and spiritual forces that kept God’s people
  in bondage.The Here and Not YetTable of ContentBelow is the table of contents showing the various topics

"Life As an Amputee - ""Rapha's Not-so-Luxury Legs""","Hello everyone,My name is Leandro Correa and my ""little' brother Raphael Correa
  has been a LAKA(Left Above Knee Amputee) since May 4th, 2013. I love
  him to death and have always been by his said through all 23 years of
  his life thus far.At first he was active and trying to live through the loss of his
  leg and he was doing well with what he had; researching all the
  prosthetic legs out there and actually trying some of them out at Mary
  Free Bed. If you know Raphael, you know he used to be a very active
  young man and could smile for dayss.. He hasnt been smiling much lately.With the pressure of being in the Andrews University DPT program
  and learning to do every daily task in a new way without a limb has
  taken a huge hit on him. (Hopping in and out of the bathroom every
  morning; wishing he didnt have to get up.. And the list goes on and
  on.) He's angry inside and wishes he would have never left the house
  that day and worse, wishes his journey in this world could have ended
  at the pole that day and the next thing he would have seen is the
  glory of our Father and Lord, Jesus Christ calling him to live eternally.I love my brother and it hurts me to see his hurting everyday that
  goes by.. There have been good days but they havent been enough to
  cancel out all the bad feelings and anger he goes through.Im crying out to all our friends and loved ones who want to see
  Rapha's beautiful smile back on his face for a very long time. We all
  know we dont belong here in this sinful/sorrowful planet and we hope
  to see Jesus' second coming ASAP but our reality for now, is here on a
  place we call Earth. In order for Rapha to get back on his feet and
  feel fulfilled again with God by his side, he needs to be able to
  experience the sweetness of life here on earth that he used to before
  he lost his leg. Running, bicycling, snowboarding, hiking, working
  out, were all things he truly enjoyed but now they have all become a
  burden without the right equipment.Amputees suffer with the loss of a limb, or 2, or 3 and they need
  something to replace their loss. In my brother's situation, he needs
  various legs in order to live a ""normal"" life and do things
  he enjoys. But those legs arent cheap! He was blessed to recieve a
  $60k Ossur Rheo 3 knee through his insurance at no cost other paying
  his monthly premium of $65; HUGE BLESSING! But when it comes to
  activity prosthetics for running, biking, snowboarding, etc, the USA
  health insurance system believes that those are luxuries and not
  necessary for daily living. I strongly disagree with that because in
  order to have a mentally, physically, and spiritually healthy life, we
  need to explore God's creation and STAY ACTIVE.My request from all of you today is to truly think about my brother
  Raphael and his well-being and help him achieve his goals. Together we
  can do BIG things! An Ottobock 3S80 knee with a 1E90 Sport Sprinter
  carbon foot is the setup he tried at Mary Free Bed and it costs about
  $8k for that running setup. The Moto Knee made by Biodapt Inc with the
  Versa foot allows him to snowboard and do all the outdoor activities
  he enjoys and that costs about $10k. So as you can see $18k is our
  goal in order to get the proper equipment for the daily activites he
  once loved to do.We have tried fundraising with AKA shirts that he created here and
  there whenever he gets called to share his testimony in different
  locations but we havent been able to get anywhere near our goal of
  $18k. If 1000 ppl (AU, GNYC, and others we may know that are willing
  to join) got together and donated $20, that ALONE would raise up
  $20,000! I believe thats a very feasible task. The $20,000 will cover
  the equipment costs and travel expenses to where they will be bought
  and installed; a socket will also need to be made for each leg. Please
  share your thoughts and help Raphael Correa continue to push on and

Get me to WEAR and helping to educate!,"I was invited to speak at WEAR in Chicago later this month. I
    will be speaking onBabywearing In Underserved Populations a topic that is close to
    my heart. I'll be speaking to babywearing educators, babywearing
    brands, and babywearing advocates about how to reach out to
    underserved communities in the babywearing world with out being
    saviors yet respecting that many of these communities have a long
    rooted history in babywearing as a cultural tradition. A cultural tradition that has been lost due to
    assimilation.As with every thing that includes traveling and
    expenses… with time being so short its really hard to organize a
    formal sponsorship and as a full time student the funds just aren't
    there. So I am asking for help from the babywearing community to
    help me make this journey possible. My Goal is $1200.. This will

The Modacity Family Discovers The Netherlands,"Over the years with our work for Modacity, we have prided ourselves
  in telling compelling stories about the people and ideas shaping our
  cities for the better, while also showing how our own family makes the
  most of living and moving in active ways. We believe cities can learn
  from one another, and strive to share lessons from our travels around
  the world, and inspire our peers with what is achievable.Very few places exemplify the positive effect that multi-modal
  planning has on its citizens than in The Netherlands. Long admired as
  a ""mecca"" for non-motorized travel, as well as welcoming and
  effective public spaces, the Dutch offer a glimpse of what “could be”
  elsewhere in the world. This summer, we are taking our family to five
  cities in The Netherlands to immerse ourselves in the Dutch lifestyle
  and really experience a model livable city. Specifically Amsterdam,
  Rotterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Groningen.The experience will allow us to better inform our writing and
  photography, but also give Coralie and Etienne, our children, the
  opportunity to see another part of this wonderful world they live in.
  Not to mention that having them along for the ride will give us a
  better impression of city planning that takes all ages and abilities
  into account. Drawing from our experiences, we will also be producing
  an illustrated article about each city, as well as five short videos
  that capture just a glimpse what each city offers.Travelling is an incredibly rewarding experience, but also requires a
  large investment. The money we raise through this campaign will help
  cover the costs of travel, accomodations, and equipment, take some of
  the stress out of the process, meaning we can really focus on the
  adventure ahead. Funding will also provide us more freedom to really
  experience what its like to live in another part of the world, and
  create a more rewarding event.We are happy for any contribution, no matter how small, to make this
  trip a truly wonderful affair. We've put together two different perks
  to thank donors for their support, and look forward to sharing our
  day-to-day on social media with all the people who help.We have always felt the best way to understand a different city or
  culture is to experience it firsthand. Long-term travel has always
  been an aspiration of ours, as has sharing this wunderlust with our
  children. Being able to begin this wish by travelling to a part of the
  world that so well reflects our desired lifestyle will be an absolute
  dream come true! And we thank everyone who helps bring this story to life.",Melissa Bruntlett,https://fundrazr.com/916Ifa,34%,$5k,$,"1,705",0,days left,16,"Vancouver, CA",2,15,23,0
Living Free & Productive Lives On The Road F/T,"Hello!We are Jerry 'Wolf' & LindaSue
  'Spirit"" Stage.  We are 58 and 51 years young respectfully.  We
  are also Native American descendants that have a small beadwork  &
  crafts business that we run part time and online.  Wolf is also a US
  Navy veteran.The VA recently discovered nodules in
  Wolf's lungs and on his vocal cords (non-cancerous) caused by living
  in an apartment with black mold.  Even after moving from the
  situation, the VA doctors have determined that his current work
  environment is just aggravating the nodules.  While he is not
  classified as disabled, he has been advised to leave the current work
  situation due to this condition and find something else.  But getting
  ready to turn 59, there are not a lot of work opportunities available.
  And neither one of us want to be added to an already over-burdened
  Social Security payout system.Long story short - we need to earn an
  honest living without doing more damage to his health or living off of
  the government.The Goal and Plan:Right now we have a craft business based on our Native heritage.  We
  are currently scheduled for 7-8 powwows this year.  We also sell
  online and at various craft fairs.  While we know we will not likely
  become rich from doing this, we do believe that we can earn an honest,
  self-sufficient living by being able to travel freely and adding more
  to the schedule.  And it will be doable without the day to day
  responsibilities that come with a permanent home base.We did try this before but did not have a solid plan in place and
  ended up living out of our van.  That situation didn't work very well
  due to the confined space and being unable to do the basics needed to
  survive properly.  This time, we do have a plan.Our Plans - Step by Step:Right now we have a step-by-step action plan in mind and would like
  to share it with you here:#1 -The first $300 will be used to have a properly installed
  hitch/wiring system done at our local U-Haul dealership.  This way we
  will know exactly what our towing capabilities will be on our '98
  Chevy Blazer.  And we will be sure that everything is done safely and
  correctly.  Planning to do this full-time, a ""gum and baling
  wire"" setup will NOT work.#2 -We are currently scouring Craigslist for
  a decent pop-up tent trailer or smaller camper (under 4000 lbs towing
  weight).  We have seen prices in the range of $900 - $2500 that would
  fit our needs.  One that we would like to get ahold of is shown in the
  following photos and is priced at $2000.  But we all know how
  Craigslist works and will keep checking daily as funds start building.#3 -In order to be completely
  self-sufficient, we are planning to add a solar panel system and
  generator so we do not have to rely on paid campsites, yet still have
  the comforts of home.  We have found that through Harbor Freight, this
  can be done for under $600 (or even less if we can catch these on sale)We Need Your Help To Make This Happen In A Timely Manner!Right now Wolf is still working part-time
  at the current job.  He has gotten his hours cut enough to just barely
  make our weekly responsibilities but he does need to get out of there
  completely to protect his health before the nodules have a more
  serious and permanent effect on his health.  With the events that we
  currently have scheduled, we will be doing our very best to get this
  plan into full motion.  But to be completely honest, we can't do it
  without YOUR help.We understand that times are rough for
  everyone right now, but even $5 can go a long way.  That is just 740
  people adding $5 to this.  I believe in human nature and I believe
  that there ARE 740 people that can do this (that is less than a value
  meal at McDonald's).  In the overall scheme of things, I do honestly
  believe this can be done.  BUT it has to start with 1 or 2 people
  making that initial help.  If you have read this far, it means that
  you have an interest in the venture.  I believe that we can count on you.Thank you,Spirit & Wolf",Lindasue Stage,https://fundrazr.com/livingfreeandhealthy,13%,$1.2k,$,159,3,Years running,8,"Taylorsville, KY, US",5,4,12,2

  YOUR HELP to make this trip go from a dream to reality!!  We are

  with one of our best friends and his family!  Benson Chui has come to
  America and stayed with our family as a foreign exchange student for
  the past two years. Now we can go stay with him and meet his family.
  We really hope that we can take advantage of this amazing  opportunity
  that his family invited us to come and take part of. Please consider
  giving to a great cause, to growing and forever enriching our
  educational experience! We know this trip will help us see people

Bill's Road to Recovery.,"Hello, My name is Jenn and I'm a friend of Bill and Ressa Moore in Calgary.Back in June 2018, Bill went for a valve replacement on his heart but
  it turned into something more severe. He had not 1 but 2 strokes the
  day after his surgery. A couple weeks later, the doctor gave Ressa the
  choice of pulling out the breathing tube and seeing what happens.
  Luckily it was 2 days before the day of pulling out the tube and the
  doctor wanted to do it sooner. It was his best chance for survival. He
  pulled through. But now he will be going to a long term care facility
  and it costs. Ressa has a hard time asking for help so let's all
  surprise her and help her get through at least some of this hard times.Bill is speaking a bit and moving a bit but he is still bed ridden.The money will go to his room accommodation at the facility, This
  would be of great help because as most of you know Ressa does not
  work. So this will help Ressa not only be able to stay in her
  apartment and help Bill stay in the facility for rehab.Any help would be amazing.I have seen Bill. He is determined to get back to his stubborn,
  chatty Kathy self. But needs help in getting there through the long

Caleb & Irlanne Wedding Gifts,"We met for the first time on June 7th 2014 at the Nations to Nations
  conference in YWAM Recife. She was going to be a student in our
  upcoming English school, and I was working with comunications for the
  school, so we already knew of each other, but had no interest. In the
  school, she was one of my students, and we began to get to know each
  other and talked often during free times. Sparks a flying and trying
  to keep ourselves on the ground, it was apparent that something was
  going on.We spent the next month getting to know each other with the help
  of skype and facebook. We spent the end of August through September
  working together in another English School, and during that time got
  the conviction and peace that we needed to proceed towards
  marriage. In November I was given engagement/wedding rings, and was
  able to officially propose to her after a wonderful evening together.Then we didn't see each other for 8 months. I went to the US,
  Colombia & Peru. While she did a counseling school, and also went
  to Argentina. In fact, the first 13 months since the first English
  school, we were apart for 11 months of that time.Now the time has finally come. On January 9th, we will come together
  as one, and begin the great adventure that is ""Marriage"".
  After all that time apart we can both say that it was completely worth
  the wait. It will also be when we have our first kiss, since we have
  decided to wait until the wedding day to have it.On Saturday, January 16th we will be moving to Colombia where we
  will spend atleast 1 year as teachers in a
  Christian Elementary/High school. We believe that this is a true gift
  from God and we're excited to make such a difference in each one of
  those kids lives. And we hope that you remember us in your prayers as
  it will surely come with some spriritual warfare.When we arrive we will have many initial costs, with visas and

  started on the right foot, and also enjoy our Honeymoon.We thank you with all our hearts!Caleb & Irlanne Burkhalter",Caleb Burkhalter,https://fundrazr.com/a15Si2,,,,,,,,,,,,

Help 'StopBrexitSteve' become an Independent MEP- Campaign2Remain,"Steve has decided that he is going to throw his hat into the
    ring and stand for election for the European Parliament as an
    Independent candidate in London who will campaign to remain in the
    EU; Campaign to Remain.On 5th September 2017 Steve took his ‘Stand of Defiance European
    Movement’ (SODEM) protest from his home town of Port Talbot to the
    seat of power, The Houses of Parliament, and he has been there ever
    since, every day that Parliament is sitting.The aim was to get a pro-EU message into the media and to stop
    the silencing of the Remain Movement who were almost entirely
    ignored and appeared to lack political representation.And so he has stood in all weathers and slowly more and more
    people came to join him and told him that he had given them hope. He
    has always said that it’s not about him but about the message. He
    has unashamedly campaigned to Stop Brexit and will continue to do
    so.  He passionately believe that the people of this nations are
    better off in the EU.Steve says ‘I cannot stand for a party. Our protest at SODEM has
    succeeded because we have always drawn cross party support and
    refused to toe any party line. This is so much bigger than any
    political party. It really is time to put country before party.I hope that pro-EU Conservative, Pro-EU Labour, Green, Lib Dem,
    Change UK, WEP supporters will break away from narrow party
    allegiances and vote for what they know is best for London and the
    UK, which is to remain in the EU. ‘The funding goal on the FundRazr is initially set at £50k£25k will allow a basic campaign with Website, admin staff,

Let's get Linda back on her feet!,"On June 4, 2016, Linda Wendt sustained a catastrophic brain
  injury after falling while she was out on a family walk in Kingston.
  We were told she might not survive, but she managed to pull through.
  After nearly three months in the hospital, Linda was discharged back
  home to continue her rehabilitation as an outpatient. We quickly
  learned that her recovery was just beginning.At 64 years young, Linda was known for her generosity, her
  stamina, and her sense of humor. She was also a talented folk musician
  who loved physical activity. David was just about to retire when the
  accident occurred. Their plan was to move to Kingston to be closer to
  their son and daughter-in-law (Phillip and Katherine) and, more
  importantly, their grandchildren (Holly and Collin). Linda was an
  incredibly engaged and dedicated grandmother, with boundless energy
  for getting down on the floor and playing with the kids. Everyone
  remarked how much she ""lit up"" when she was around them.Since Linda's injury, she has been severely limited by various
  physical complications of the brain injury. The most significant of
  these are crushing fatigue, dizziness/fainting owing to sudden drops
  in blood pressure, and nearly complete vision loss. Luckily, Linda has
  retained her core personality and cognitive abilities, and she is
  approaching her limitations with a sense of practical optimism.
  Unfortunately, she is not able to do most of the things she used to
  enjoy (reading, gardening, going for long walks, running around with
  the grandkids, etc.). Even playing music will be a big challenge, as
  she will not be able to follow regular music scores.This is why we have started this campaign: To raise funds to
  help get Linda back on her feet when she returns to Kingston for good
  in November. Although the vision loss is permanent, the other problems
  have the potential to improve through hard work and regular outpatient
  rehabilitation in the home. There are also many assistive devices that
  could help Linda to compensate for the disabilities (for example,
  mobility aids, safety equipment, and electronic devices). These things
  cost money, and lots of it! For example, a low vision music reader can
  cost $3,000 (http://www.dancingdots.com/main/index.htm) and
  Phillip estimates that a year of twice weekly private rehabilitation
  would cost around $9,600 Cdn. Although we are lucky to live in a
  country where core health services are publicly subsidized, these
  particular services and items are not. We believe that having access
  to them could make the difference between thriving and surviving. You
  can check out various innovative products available to people with low
  vision at this link:http://shop.cnib.ca/.Linda has done so much for so many over the years and now we
  have an opportunity to return the favour, in whatever small way we
  can. $5, $10, or whatever you can manage would make a difference. For
  those of you from the United States, your donations would reap the
  benefit of the current exchange rate, which would increase the value
  of each US dollar by 25% when converted to Canadian funds!
  Contributions will be automatically deposited in a PayPal account
  under David's name, to be used at Linda and David's discretion. We
  will provide regular updates on Linda's progress and keep you in the
  loop about significant purchases and services that have been arranged.**If you are donating from Canada, please note that your
  donation will be processed in U.S. currency.**",Katherine Waller,https://fundrazr.com/71AiF8,40%,$10k,$,"4,015",2,Years running,41,"Kingston, ON, CA",10,8,14,5

Help a family run business get back on their feet,"Hello everyone. This is a call for help from bangalore  ,india. This
  pizzeria has been our family business for the past 5 years. Until 2016
  business was fine.In 2017 the location of our restaurant had to face 2 bigger brands as
  competition on the same floor. And our business could not compete.The whole year we have been taking loans to keep the place running
  ,thinking it will get better. But unfortunately it didn't and now we
  are drowning in loans and had to close shop in December 2017.I created this campaign to ask for your help to reopen our pizzeria
  in a smaller place and to help us financially till things settle.Because right now we have no income and no savings as we drained

Vying Against AT/RT - Violet's Battle,"Hi! My name is Karen Sawada - Crown. I would like to share with you
  the story of Violet and the battle that this 2 year old warrior
  princess has already fought in such a short time period.On June 12, 2017 the lives of my close personal friends Christa and
  her partner Wayne changed within mere minutes. Theirvivacious
    and vibrant 2 year old daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor.On June 13, 2017 Violet was rushed into surgery to relieve the
    pressure on her brain that the tumor was causing.On June 14, 2017 Violet would have her first brain surgery. Her tumor is in the Posterior Fossa, which
    is the small space in the brain between the stem and cerebellum. The
    cerebellum is responsible for our movement, balance and coordination
    and the brain stem is responsible for controlling our primary body
    functions like our breathing. Because this is such a small space the
    tumor was pressing on her cerebellum and brain stem causing havoc
    within her body.During her surgery she suffered a stroke in the brain stem which
    caused her to lose movement, speech and the ability to express any
    emotion since the brain stem controls basically all life functions.The part of the tumor removed was to sent away for pathology and
    for almost a week it was a waiting game.On June 15, 2017 while recovering Violet had a seizure and they
    were not sure what caused it and why she was not waking up. As
    everyone waited on the results the swelling started to go down in
    her brain stem and she started to slowly open her eyes. At that
    point they realized the extent of the stroke damage and that Violet
    will require long term therapy to possibly gain back her basic
    functioning abilities.On June 23, 2017 Christa and Wayne received devastating news
    that would turn everyone's world upside down; Violet had stage 4
    Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT), which is an extremely rare
    aggressive brain cancer that mostly affects children under the age
    of three.The AT/RT regimens are very intense treatments. Violet's
        treatmentplan will start out with a round of
        chemotherapy; three cycles and each cycle will last 22-30 days
      each. She is currently on her second cycle. After she will
      require another MRI and possibly another brain surgery. Than she
      gets another round of chemotherapy which she will require stem
      cell transplants during to help her recover. Finally she will need
      radiation therapy to finish up her treatmentsViolet and her familyREALLY, REALLYneed your help
  and support during this time. She is not in a local hospital, she is
  currently at McMaster Hospital in Hamilton. Christa and Wayne want to
  stay with Violet every step of the way, right now they are not working
  and the bills at home are piling up, they have had to use their
  savings to stay with her. The expected stay between McMaster and
  eventually Sick Kids is between 8 - 12 months.The generosity and kindness that has already been shown has been
  overwhelming, my hope is that we raise enough funds so that Christa
  and Wayne do not have to worry about any financial matters, that they
  can concentrate on the well - being of their daughter and the long
  road that she still has ahead of her.",Team Violet - Fight Like a Girl,https://fundrazr.com/VioletsBattle,32%,$10k,$,"3,220",2,Years running,44,"Niagara Falls, ON, CA",8,17,19,3
Secureflatmates & Splitit app.,"Why am I trying to raise funds for this project idea I have come up
  with? My story is long and hard, yet through Adversity  we can become
  very creative. Upon having to go live in a flatting situation and
  requiring flatmates to survive, I have found myself very disappointed
  at the amount of dishonest people in Christchurch NZ flatting
  situations who turned out to be ""dishonest"" leaving me with
  their debt from when they had up and disappeared, I came up with this
  Idea to develop a secure way of securing an honest flatmate.My goal and dream is to have the ""SecureFlatmates""website built soYOUthe people looking for flatmates
  can secure trustworthy honest ones. yes Christchurch is not the only
  place that lives with the nightmare flatmates who have hidden agendas
  of depict, manipulations and lies.It is very hard finding a good flatmate and I know this from
  experience, I have had to endure flatmates who are untidy and refuse
  to pay what is owed. I have come home to flatmates who have
  disappeared without paying their rent and have stolen off me. I did
  not need this in a time where I walked out on a dysfunctional
  relationship that had cleaned me out money wise. Most flatmates seem
  to have a sense of entitlement and no respect at all and the
  secureaflatmate and the Splitit app will make the much needed changes
  thereby making all accountable for their expenses.This is how I have come up with the idea of creating a website that
  will helpYOUsecure a sound and honest flatmate and
  the  Splitit app attached offers security for the head tenant. There
  are many points of differences within the website compared to other
  online flatmate searching platforms, all will be revealed upon the
  pre-launch of the website.I will not reveal the full model but you can be assured thatYOURloved ones will be secure in knowing this
  website offers a better platform for getting the best honest flatmates.I knowYOUwould wantyoursonsanddaughterssafe within their flatting situations,
  knowing they have honest secure flatmates they can trust fully.>> How would you like your son or daughter, sister or
      brother to be misled while having to live with dishonest people?I know I did not like it,  I never felt like I could not
      leave any of them in my home with all my stuff and this turned out
      to be the case.>> Wouldn’t it be great to know that your loved ones do
      not have to find the money to recover what is owed from an
      ex-flatmate.I wished I didn't have to take
      them to Tenancy Tribunal which was a waste of money, because they
      still owe me what was not paid even though I won the case through
      the tribunal.Dishonest people just do not  care and will never pay even
      if you win within the Tribunal and we all know what it costs to
      get a lawyer to go to court to recover through having payments
      taken out of their wages.>> Would you like to know they have sound and honest people
      living with them?Iwished I had.>>Isn't it a good thing knowing that having honest
      people living with your loved ones gives you peace of mind?I wished I could have trusted
      these Flatmates to be left in my home alone.>>Wouldn't it be peaceful knowing that your gifts
      to your loved ones are secure?For me it was the fact that my
      mothers last gift to me before she died was stolen.Let’s work together to make your loved ones ""SecureFlatmates""and givingYOUpeace of mind.In my experience, I never realized the amount of dishonest people
  that move into homes who have hidden agendas and a sense of
  entitlement. This is another reason why I came up with the idea of the
  developing the website ""SecureFlatmates""in order to help prevent this from happening to others, others beingYOU&YOURfamily members.The funds are for the further development of the website.>>The development of the app for the Head Tenant,
    Flatmates and Landlords securing payments are made on time with full
    Id details securing all.>> Website development, the remainder which is what the
    funding is required for:>>SEO ( Search Engine Optimization.>>Underwriting for Insurance for Head Tenant and landlord.""SecureFlatmates,YOUknow you want it,YOUknow you
    need it.""Would you fund your children's flatting safety?Would you make a $10 gift to
          this cause to keepYOU
            & YOURfamily safe in flats?TheSPILITapp that prevents theHead Tenantpaying for flatmates share of the flats expenses left behind,
      eg.Prevention rather than cure.Power bill, pH,
    Internet. The Splitit app also will remind flatmates two days prior
    that rent is due. New potential flatmates must upon registering on
    the Secure Flatmates Website, register for this app and if they do
    not accept then they will not be accepted within the website for
    use. The app also will align a pin for their pH account so toll
    calls are paid by the person making the tolls on the flats landline
    thereby making each flatmate legally bound for their share of
    accounts, accountable to the companies and freeing up the head
    tenant having to take them to court to recover what is owed.There is still loads of work to be done in the background, but I
    am determined to make this happen for the security for all so you do
    not have to live the nightmare I have had to live so  YOU and YOUR
    loved ones are not left with the debt from dishonest flatmates.Would you make a $10 gift to this
        cause to keep YOU & YOUR family safe in Flats?You will get a discounted price when registering for basic

  already are is what truly matters most.Derick and I have been together 8 years this coming 4th of July.  We
  have been through it all together!  I have helped Derick in raising

PANSAA Graduation Fundraiser,"More than 25 years ago, Black nursing students at UCLA came together
  to establish the Pan African Nursing Student and Alumni Association
  (PANSAA). Today, PANSAA remains an important aspect of student life
  for UCLA’s Black nursing students and supporters. Our purpose is:To provide a forum that addresses the academic, professional, and
    social concerns of students enrolled in the UCLA School of Nursing.To promote a celebration of diversity and unity through its
    support of academia and professional opportunity.To enhance the education of nursing students by providing
    opportunities to network with esteemed UCLA School of Nursing
    Alumni, Faculty, and Staff.To assist in recruiting and retaining students of color in the
    School of Nursing.To enrich the community through service with the collaborative
    efforts of existing UCLA organizations and local agencies.For the past five years, PANSAA has held a formal graduation
  celebration for its members. The PANSAA graduation dinner has become
  thelargest PANSAA gathering of the academic yearand our
  alumni, students and supporters thoroughly enjoy this gathering.This year’s ceremony is scheduled for evening ofFriday, June 10th.Each graduate is invited to the dinner, free of charge.During the
  dinner, the graduates are presented with PANSAA stoles to wear to
  graduation and given a small gift.In previous years, the dinner was greatly supported by the Dean’s
  Office. As a response to an anticipated lack of funding, PANSAA board
  members have planned several fundraisers. However, PANSAA needs
  additional financial resources in order to fully support the PANSAA
  graduation dinner. So far, we have experienced moderate success
  raising funds through our t-shirt sales, TV tapings, other fundraising
  activities and alumni donations.As of today, we still need$5,000 in donations and
    fundraisersto pay for PANSAA’s graduation. Donors may
  claim tax deductions for donations made to PANSAA. We will provide the
  federal taxpayer ID number once the donation has been received. We
  have already raised $1,000 and hope that the money earned from our
  fundraising efforts and your generous donation will cover the $6,000
  needed to pay for our annual graduation dinner. To donate, please give
  to this online fundraising campaign.Thank you in advance!PANSAA",Pan African Nursing Student and Alumni Association,https://fundrazr.com/f13Geb,6%,$5k,$,320,0,days left,6,"Los Angeles, CA, US",10,9,1,4

Please help Jong & Sam get out of financial burden,"I'm Samantha Dy. I have created this campaign in hopes to help
    my mother and I get into a more stable financial position. She has
    sacrificed a lot over the years as a single parent.Up until three years ago my mother and I used to live in a small
    apartment in Lake Oswego, OR. Right now we have moved back to the
    Philippines in order for to get a more affordable education and be
    closer to our extended family. I had dreamed of studying fine arts
    or advertising at my parent's university but due to the suddenly
    annulment of child support I had to look for cheaper alternative. I
    have since enrolled at Metropolitan Medical Center College of Arts,
    Science and Technology as a Business Administration student. I have
    grown to enjoy this field, especially when it came to accounting or
    just math in general and want to go into advertisement after graduation.On average it cost about $550 - 600 (PHP 27, 500 - 30,000*) per
    semester but over the years the cost has gone up due to the
    increasing miscellaneous and other fees. My father would still send
    money for tuition but on some occasions they we're not enough to
    cover the installment payments. Eventually all of our savings then,
    as well as our back up money has already been depleted before my
    mother could find stable work.As of nowmy mother is working with less than $400 (PHP 20,000*)
    incometo help finance my studies and at the same time
    pay for all the expenses. Our expenses monthly looks as follows:
    electric bills are about $60 (PHP 3,000*), water about $25 (PHP
    1,250*) , food is roughly $120 (PHP 6,000*), and our allowances and
    transportation is about $120 (PHP 6,000*) also for the both of us.
    The difference from what she earns to our expenses is often payed by
    my grandparents or sometimes her friends. Some are given of good
    will while others are loans. Other times we would sell some of our
    possessions or make small sacrifices in the budget. I wanted to help
    her but she always tells me to focus on finishing my bachelors
    degree first. It pains me every time I watch her struggling to make
    ends meet.She wouldn't even tell me how much money she owes, and says I
    shouldn’t worry. But it has and I know we have accumulated a lot of
    debt! I know she was borrowing money in hopes to keep us afloat. But
    we are barely making it through the weeks paying bills and buying
    necessities. I still have about three more semesters of college and
    my upcoming senior year will be a lot more costly.The money raised from this campaign will beused to help
      payback our debts, pay for our bills, to buy our necessities and
      also fund my remaining tuition fees. This is will help
    lessen the heavy burden on my mother's shoulders and provide us some
    relief from worrying about future expenses for a while.Please helpmy mother and me overcome this financial
    burden. I know this is not a permanent solution but it will still
    allow us make it through these upcoming months. I would forever be
    grateful to those who help fund my campaign, or even just share my
    story to others.Any amount of donations and shares will be
      greatly appreciated to reach $ 1,000 (PHP 50,000*).With
    all the bad luck I've been experiencing lately, this will truly
    brighten things up for a change. Thank you so very much.*Rough exchange rate is US $2 = PHP 100",Samantha Dy,https://fundrazr.com/91EAf6,109%,₱50k,₱,"54,600",0,days left,22,"Manila, PH",9,23,20,0
Help Brian's family tide over the month!,"Hello, I am Priyank Kumar, running this fundraiser on behalf of my
  friend Brian Blassingame. Brian lives in Colorado Springs, is
  neurodivergent with Asperger's Syndrome and is going through
  homelessness to be able to provide for his family in the Philippines.
  Brian is an American citizen hailing from Fort Worth, Texas; he has
  worked as a Greenpeace canvasser and activist, an English instructor,
  ballot access petitioner and is an extremely talented bamboo craftsman
  and flute maker.Current Situation:Brian is currently stuck in the US away from his family who he
    has been supporting on his disability benefits. Brian returned to
    the US after losing his job in the Philippines during the 2008-09
    crash on a repatriation loan from the government. Ever since his
    return to the US he has faced immense financial and social
    challenges in his day to day life and in providing for his family.
    Not least on account of how the neurodivergent are treated in our
    society. To make matters worse, a bureaucratic mess up has caused
    his disability benefit pay out for the current month to not come
    through. He has been trying to resolve the issue but the officials
    are moving at a snail's pace. The lack of funds has lead to his
    family falling behind on their bills enough that their water, gas
    and electricity supplies have been cut, worse they are facing eviction.What will be the money used for?The entire sum raised will go to Brian's family for
  rent and bills.All contributions will go to Brian's paypal
  account.If possible, any extra money raised will be used for
  food and necessary expenses till Brian gets his benefits sorted out.Background on Brian's situationThis circumstances described above may raise
  questions in your mind as to the details like why Brian is stuck here?
  Why doesn't he bring his family over? What challenges is he facing in
  becoming financially stable? etc. The following account will provide
  you with clarity on the situation. Please bear with the length of this
  as his situation is particularly complicated and made worse by
  bureaucratic tangles.Belowis his story in his own words:""I have not been allowed to see my family face to face or
    hold them for over 7 years now. By way of introduction, they are my
    wife Sherelyn who goes by Sheng (pronounced shāng) for short and our
    two children Stanley (my stepson) and my daughter Lillian Inez. They
    are in the Philippines and I am trapped here in United States and
    not allowed to leave nor am I allowed to bring my family here. Here
    (in short) is our story... I lived in the Philippines for 6 years
    after going into voluntary exile in 2004 over Guantanamo, pointless
    wars, etc. which I felt I could not stay here without facilitating.
    During that time I met my wife Sheng, we fell in love, moved in
    together and had our daughter Lillian Inez. I call Sheng my wife
    because we are committed to stay together for life and we have a
    family together. However because I overstayed my visa when I became
    unable to pay immigration fees in order to stay with Sheng, this
    made me an 'undocumented alien' and therefore ineligible to marry
    under Philippine law. In 2009 like many people around the world I
    was laid off from my job (I was working teaching Maritime English to
    Eastern European and Russian Merchant Mariners, online for a German
    shipping company.) We were going hungry and facing homelessness so I
    had no choice but to go to the U.S. Embassy and take what is called
    a repatriation loan and return to the United States in February of
    2010. When you take a repatriation loan from the U.S. Government
    they take your passport from you, punch holes in it and cancel it.
    Then they give you a new one that is good for about a week to travel
    back on. You cannot renew your passport until you repay the loan.
    Herein lies the trouble, because I was struggling to support two
    households (myself here and simultaneously my family in the
    Philippines as well) there was never anything left to give the
    government. I was therefore been unable to repay the (originally
    $900 +) loan within the first 6 months after I returned. After the
    loan became six months delinquent, it was given over to a collection
    agency and an absurd usury was added to the debt. The last time I
    looked at it (about two years into the process, so about 5 years
    ago) they had mushroomed it into an over $23,000 debt. I don't know
    what they claim I owe them now, maybe it is over a million dollars?
    That has left me trapped here in the United States on the opposite
    side of the world from my family, and my family without a husband
    and father. The second part of this problem is that the only way I
    could ever hope to afford to bring Sheng and the children here to
    the U.S. would be via a fiancée visa but you are required to have
    seen your fiancée face-to-face within 2 years and I have been stuck
    here for 7 years. I tried very hard for the first two years to find
    a co-sponsor for the fiancée visa but no one would help me. I have
    now found someone willing to be a co-sponsor but I have to see her
    face-to-face to even begin the fiancée visa process. Further adding
    to the confusion is the matter of my daughter Lillian Inez'
    citizenship. Because she is my daughter she has a right to be
    recognized as a United States citizen. However when I was in the
    Philippines, the U.S. Embassy (unlike in the cases of ALL other
    Americans I have known there) refused to work with me at all on the
    matter of my daughters' citizenship until I got her Philippine NSO
    (National Statistics Office) birth certificate. Since we didn't have
    the money to pay the bribes necessary to get this document quickly
    it took two years for my wife to be able to get Lillians' NSO birth
    certificate and by that time, I was back here in the United States.
    I immediately contacted the U.S. Department of State thinking that
    finally I would be able to get something done for my family. However
    they then informed me that they were unwilling to work with me
    anywhere on the face of the Earth, except for the United States
    Embassy at Manila to which they are preventing me from returning...
    I have been cut off at every turn. When I left the Philippines my
    daughter was one and a half years old, now she is 9 and I have
    missed her entire childhood. I cannot begin to describe to you the
    amount of pain involved in that fact for her and I both.On top of this all, I am an aspie which is to say that I have
    Aspergers' Syndrome, a form of autism. (I hate saying 'I have'
    because it makes it sound like a disease!) I also have Major
    Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder which are
    common comorbidity factors with Asperger's. I am currently fighting
    for SSI and I am in the process awaiting the results of my appeal.
    In order to be able to afford to send money to my family and take
    care of them I have had to spend most of the last seven years
    homeless. I am currently homeless and sleeping in my car. I have
    been doing so since early December last year here in Colorado
    Springs, Colorado. Actually depending on how you define homeless,
    I've spent almost the entirety of the time since I returned to the
    United States that way, since with rare exceptions the only times I
    have been housed since returning to the United States has been upon
    occasion living in motels.""In closing, I would thank you greatly for taking the time to
    consider this appeal and reading this post. If you are able to
    contribute anything, it will be immensely helpful and appreciated.
    This spat of trouble has really made Brian's life that much worse,
    though he was already facing immense challenges and pain day to day
    before that. It's a small sum if we come together but it bears an
    immense implication for his family's well being. So, I would request
    you to consider contributing whatever amount you can and if you are
    not able to contribute financially you can still be a huge help by
    sharing this appeal with your friends and family.Thank you.",Monu,https://fundrazr.com/d1HUKd,72%,$250,$,180,0,days left,6,"Colorado Springs, CO, US",9,18,1,0

  at 9 AM and concludes with an evening parade. Saturday’s activities
  typically draws around 7,000 people who eat, drink, listen to music,
  shop, play games, and stroll through town. Festival of the Forks is a
  family-friendly party for all ages.During the planning stages of last year’s Festival of the Forks,
  Albion decided to hold a 3-on-3 basketball tournament which we named
  in honor of Tillman Cornelius Jr., our beloved, deceased Albion
  Recreation Department leader. Fifty-six young and adult men played in
  Albion’s first ever, Tillman Cornelius Jr., 3-on-3 Basketball
  Tournament in September 2014.Registration was free. Pre-registration was required. Brackets were
  determined and games commenced at 1 PM in downtown, Albion with
  assistance provided from the Albion College basketball team. Each
  player received a complimentary tee-shirt and tournament winners
  (within their age groups) received small prizes.This year, we would like to expand and enhance the Tillman Cornelius,
  Jr., 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament to include women and girls. In order
  to do this, we need to purchase two additional portable basketball
  hoops. Last year’s two portable hoops cost nearly $3,000: we expect
  costs to remain roughly the same this year.Likewise, with the addition of more players, we’ll need more prizes!
  We expect our tee-shirt/prizes costs to double or be near $3,000. Your
  financial contribution to the Tillman Cornelius, Jr., 3-on-3
  Basketball Tournament is greatly appreciated and will help our women
  compete alongside our men in Albion, MI.Please contribute today! We need to raise $6,000 by August 1st in
  order to buy the hoops and tee shirts for the Festival of the Forks,

DAT - Fundraiser for DIS,"DIS was envisioned by two childhood friends, Jonathan Matic and
  Halashon Sianipar.  Jon had been brewing beers for a while.  Hala had
  been organizing events for a while.  They both loved cookouts so DIS
  was born.Why DIS?  Basically, Jon and Hala were sitting around trying to
  figure out what to call ""dis"" event and just started calling
  it ""dis.""They began inviting friends and family and everybody brought a little
  something.  They played kickball, danced, ate, drank, threw water
  balloons, ran potato sack races... all the fun things of summer.  The
  first DIS took place in 2010 on the Dover, NJ side of Hedden Park. 
  Over the years, the community cookout has grown into a something like
  a reunion/end of summer party.As the size has grown so has the cost.  People have been offering to
  donate time, goods, and money throughout the years.  This year a
  nonprofit was formed called Becoming One Community Association (BOCA)
  to ensure traditions like DIS continue.Staying true to tradition, the fundraiser for DIS is called DAT.  Our
  first DAT is taking placed the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth, June
  19th, 2015.  It's a pretty special day.  Happy Juneteenth!  Happy
  DAT!  Happy DIS!Please, help us continue these traditions for our community.-BOCA Board of Directors",Hala ThyName,https://fundrazr.com/710Wm8,,,,,,,,,,,,

Send Shannon to Mozambique with SAM Ministries!,"The JourneyIn the Summer of 2010 I had the
    incredible opportunity of taking a team of first year nursing
    students fromPrairie Collegeto Mozambique Africa whereS.A.M. Ministriesserves. We spent several
    weeks working alongside the team as they served the people of
    Mozambique. It was aheart-wrenching and life changing
  experience. One that I would never forget.  That began my love for the
  incredible people of Mozambique and it planted a deep desire in my
  heart to return there to serve in any way I can.What will I bedoingS.A.M. Ministrieshas many ministries on the go
  and so I hope to be able to be used wherever needed.  I plan to focus
  on helping in the area of Leadership Training.S.A.M. Ministrieshas a leadership training
  centre where Men and Women are being prepared to meet the needs of
  their own people. I believe this is key to the future of Mozambique
  and so I hope to help train these leaders in the area of counselling
  to give them a few more tools so they can meet the needs of their own
  nation.I also have a passion for seeing women rise up and be equipped to
  stand up for themselves and their families. S.A.M.'s women's program
  is called Simukai (Stand Up) and it is reaching illiterate women in
  rural areas of Mozambique’s four central provinces. For more
  information please seeSimukai (Stand Up).  I hope to be part of this
  ministry in various ways as well.S.A.M. Ministrieshas many other ministries such as:Child sponsorshipOrphan sponsorshipEmergency FeedingHealthAgricultureVocational TrainingAviationSo please check out theirwebsitefor more details.When will this happen?That is up to all of you! I am praying and hoping to head for Brazil
  for language learning (for 3 months) in January 2017.  However, that
  will all depend on how far along I am in support raising. If I'm not
  far enough along then my departure date would need to be adjusted accordingly.I'm excited to begin this next part of the journey. I want to be able
  to share what I'm learning, doing, and seeing so I hope you will
  consider being part of my support team in whatever way you are able!What will it take to get me there?I need to raise a total of $5,632.00 per month.  Monthly giving can
  be done throughS.A.M. Ministries Monthlygiving.
  Please choose Mozambique leadership training partner as the fund type.
  This monthly giving is what will enable me to live and work in Mozambique.In addition I need to raise $31,279.00 in outgoing costs.  This is
  for things like visa's, travel, and things I will need to live in
  Mozambique.One timegifts can be given through this campaign.Eventually I will need to raise an additional $60-$65,000 for a
  vehicle.  This will be used for my ministry but also for the general
  ministry of the mission. Again, donations towards this can be done
  through this campaign which I will leave open until all the one-time
  costs are covered.I know that this seems like a lot. All of this will be put toward the
  important work being done in Mozambique. I pray you will catch the
  vision for what God is doing in Mozambique and that you will partner

  had just moved in with Austin the day before they left.The car they were in burst into flames upon impact so as a result,
  Austin suffered 3rd degree burns to the muscle on 22% of his body and
  was brought to the Regional Burn Center at Tampa General Hospital
  where he was put into a medically-induced coma. In total, he will

  lend a helping hand to anyone, whether it be money, his time, or
  advice. This time last year (in May 2015), he spent two weeks
  volunteering his time in Haiti to help others in need. He is
  hard-working and does whatever he can to make sure his kids are raised
  to be happy, healthy, and respectful.As if the emotional aspect of the accident were not enough, he is

Homeless Child Center Aims for Self-Sufficiency!,"A wonderful group of kids have found shelter, support, education, and
  happiness for the last 4 years, but they face the streets again very
  soon unless we raise $5300 by September 30, 2016. The property owner
  must sell quickly (medical/financial problems) so we have a very short
  time to put the first 50% into escrow. If we hit our Sept 30th goal,
  we'll have until January 30, 2017 to raise the remaining $14,000 and
  make the Homeless Children's Residential Center of Ouidah a reality.If we fail, these children could be back to a life of abuse,
  molestation, child slavery, and crime on the streets.  Most of these
  kids were beaten and sexually abused.  One was trafficked and escaped
  after 1 year as a domestic slave.The project to help these children was started by Martine de
    Souza and will be managed by APEF, a registered NGO founded by
    Martine, which has been helping women and children in remote
    villages of Benin since 2001. For the last 4 years, helping local
    homeless children has been a personal project for Martine, as she
    fed, clothed, and counseled 8-14 children at her own expense.
    According to Martine, “When these children began appearing in the
    market and on the streets, I saw it as a cancer on my community,”
    and she took action. Since then, the kids have flourished in every
    way. Let’s help that continue.The 1750 sq ft home sits within a walled and gated compound
    (offering safety) next door to Martine’s home. The lot is large
    enough for the children to grow vegetables and raise animals. The
    home has 4 large bedrooms, two baths, and a large open
    kitchen/dining/living area. The roof is prepped for second-story
    expansion, if needed. The structure is complete, but the toilets and
    showers need to be purchased and installed. The kitchen and dining
    area need to be equipped and bunk beds set up for the children. The
    U.S. and French Embassies have offered funding for facility
    improvements after the property is acquired.Help raise the $5300 to get us to 50% and secure this home and
  nurturing environment.  In Phase II, we'll raise the remaining $14,000
  and by January 31, 2017, I will travel to Benin to assure the

Raising Money for the Funeral cost of Isaiah Moore,"We are raising money to cover burial expenses for Isaiah Moore,
    a very loved young man who was tragically taken from us far too
    soon. Isaiah was a 20 year old, funny, caring, energetic and
    passionate person who adored his 3 siblings, his parents and his
    girlfriend of 4 years. He was coming home from work on his
    skateboard Thursday night around 10pm when he was struck by a
    vehicle. Upon his arrival to the hospital, he was unresponsive and
    has remained in that state since. Isaiah made the selfless choice to
    be an organ donor prior to his accident and as hard as it is to let
    him go, we stand by and respect his decision and find peace in
    knowing that he will continue to live on through his recipients. His
    passing gives new life to several people and that is such a
    beautiful gift he wanted to give. Nobody ever expects for this type
    of thing to happen and we are never truly prepared for it when it
    does. Unfortunately, there is no insurance in place to cover his
    final expenses and we are in need of help to lay him to rest. Any
    amount of financial assistance would be such a big blessing to us
    during this difficult and painful time. Prayers for his family and
    friends and all of those who's lives he impacted would be deeply
    appreciated. Thank you. God bless.Whether or not you can or cannot help Please Share! Thank you
      so much! Prayer is also very much appreciated!

Help Me Keep A Roof Over Their Heads,"My name is Brandi. And this is my last resort. My husband got laid
  off from work at the end of July and received less then a weeks pay.
  When we moved into our apartment, the cosigner, who was also a
  supervisor at my husbands company guaranteed work for at least 2
  years. From May 2017 until July 2017 my husband made over 8000. We
  were not living above our means, nor spending excessive amounts of
  money. But we were able to keep the roof over our heads and food on
  the table and provide for our kids while I got to stay home with our
  girls. The cosigner had said due to the situation he would take care
  of Augusts rent. However he did not follow through. I literally have
  contacted every church and organization in the Denver/Aurora area
  seeking assistance. I have the emails and my call log saved so that I
  can show that I literally have tried everything possible in order to
  obtain the rent owed. No one has rental assistance funds available
  currently. I forgot to mention that a week before he got laid off our
  vehicle broke down and was towed. So we have had no vehicle, no steady
  income (my husband has done some cash daily jobs while he is looking
  for full time employment) and since we have no family or friends here
  the worry of where we would go with our kids if evicted. Despite all
  this I maintain faith that God will provide and see us through. I was
  able to make it to the court hearing and was able to get a little
  extra time. My daughters start school on Monday and my oldest daughter
  turns 7 next Wed. the 23rd. Which is also the day we either have to
  pay or be escorted out. I have secured employment as a waitress and my
  husband has decided to go thru a temp agency where we will have a
  steady income and be able to pay rent in September. My concern is
  obtaining the money by the 23rd in order to not only keep a roof over
  my daughters heads but so that my daughters dont start the new school
  year off in chaos. I also want my daughter to be able to have a worry
  free birthday. I have faith that God will open doors and continue to
  open them and my family is going to be abundantly blessed and we will
  one day be able to pay the gift forward. If I could get 1000 people to
  just donate $3 dollars it would cover all that we owe, with late fees
  and the court fee as well. Keeping my kids stable is the most
  important thing and I appreciate anyone who is willing to help. For
  anyone who would prefer to donate with the apartment directly it is

Giving Back to the One Who Gives So Much,"This year has been very difficult for my family and household. I
  wouldn't be here now asking you for assistance if I didn't view it as
  something that would benefit my mom, which I truly believe it will.In May, our lease in Greeley was up. We temporarily moved into my
  aunt's house, which we were forced to leave sooner than we expected.
  We found our current house, for which we were truly lucky given the
  timing and circumstances surrounding us leaving my aunt's house, and
  everything seemed to begin to fall into place.That was until we actually moved in. On our second day in the new
  house, what we believe to be a pre-existing condition that was
  un-mentioned to us prior to moving in caused a toilet in then upstairs
  bathroom to overflow. The flooding spread through three different
  rooms, causing potentially thousands of dollars in damages. Our
  landlord is not taking any responsibility, and is insisting that it is
  essentially something that we caused in such a short period of time.
  That was financial burden number one.Additionally, since my mom is currently interviewing for a new job,
  the source of our next months rent is unknown. I am of course going to
  help chip in, but I just started my new job and do not have the
  financial means to be able to pay the entire month.  This was
  financial burden number two.These two large sums of money that will be due soon caused my mom to
  experience an overload of stress, leading to a necessary and temporary
  hospitalization. We are uninsured. This means that the ambulance ride,
  hospital bills, and continued treatment will be out of pocket. Unless,
  that is, we can get put on Medicaid. The application process is in the
  works for that.Nonetheless, we are very unsure about how to go about this. I am not
  robbing any banks, and I have minimal savings. Same with my mom. Many
  people have asked how they can help. A surprise contribution to help
  her financially would alleviate some of that stress, I am sure. The
  love and outpouring of support is beyond appreciated, even if you
  cannot contribute financially.She has given me so much, in terms of support, love, and financial
  assistance on my journeys that I would love to give back to her in the
  way that she has given to me. If you have even $10, it would be
  greatly appreciated. Thanks ❤️",Anna Kruger,https://fundrazr.com/01GHX3,17%,$5k,$,865,2,Years running,12,"Denver, US",7,20,3,3
Jordan and Sabrina's Dream Fund,"When Jordan and I got engaged, we were more excited than we have
  ever been for the future. We both have so much family that are all so
  happy for us and want to attend the wedding. There is actually so much
  family that we are not sure how we will be able to afford to have
  everyone there on our special day. We cannot afford to cut the list
  short, seeing as to how we only invited the absolute minimum amount we
  possibly could. Even with the smallest list we could draft, we are
  short by $2,000. Although I'm afraid we have already disappointed some
  people by getting married so young, I still want them to be a part of
  what should be the best day of our lives. Just because we are young
  does not mean that we shouldn't have an extraordinary night. Every
  couple deserves to experience that. We pay for college, rent, bills,
  and now a wedding. We would greatly appreciate making this day an
  affordable celebration for everyone that we love. It wouldn't be
  complete if anyone at all was left out. We had to change our date
  recently, as well. We realized we will not be able to afford all
  expenses and a honeymoon in one year at the rate we are at with
  emergenies coming up here and there. That being said, we appreciate

A new leg for Caleb by Christmas,"Caleb Swanepoel, a 20 yr old University of Cape Town
  drama student, lost his right leg in a shark attack at Buffalo Bay in
  June 2015. Caleb is an active, ambitious, and extraordinary young man
  and we would love to help him live a full and boundless life, with
  infinite possibilities.Our aim is to raise R1.4 million by Christmas to finance
    Caleb’s prosthetic leg.While on holiday at Buffalo Bay, South Africa, with his parents, two
  brothers, two sisters, and the family dog, Caleb Swanepoel was
  attacked by a Great White shark and lost his right leg above the knee.
  Caleb was body surfing with his two brothers when the attack took
  place, as his family and friends watched from the beach. Just before
  the attack, Caleb shouted to his brothers to swim back to shore, after
  which the shark took his leg. Hearing Caleb call, his younger brother
  swam back and began pulling him to shore. The shark approached the
  boys, circling them twice before attacking again, resulting in two
  deep lacerations on Caleb’s left knee and biting his brother’s
  flipper. However, the boys reached the shore and Caleb was pulled out
  of the water by his mother and brothers. The emergency care provided
  by Caleb’s family, friends, fellow surfers and bystanders who assisted
  on the scene, prior to the arrival of the NSRI (National Sea Rescue
  Institute) and emergency services, contributed to saving his life.
  After an hour, Caleb was airlifted to George Mediclinic, where he
  underwent immediate surgery. The doctors explained that it is a
  miracle that Caleb is alive. His main artery in his right leg went
  into spasm after being ripped by the shark, preventing Caleb from
  bleeding to death. Two days later, he underwent further surgery to
  close the stump. During the following 9 days in hospital, Caleb’s
  wounds were monitored for infection and he made exceptional progress.
  Now temporarily at home, Caleb and his family are making plans for the
  months ahead, which will involve rehabilitation, the fitting of his
  prosthetic leg, and the continuation of his drama degree.Caleb’s character is the determining factor of his future. He has
  remained extremely positive since the attack and shows no sign of
  giving up his ambitions and dreams. He is determined to grow and learn
  from this experience, and come out stronger than before. Caleb is not
  only inwardly strong, but has remained a constant to the people around
  him. He has a genuine love for others, being always a kind, giving,
  and sensitive friend, brother, and son. In his words, “this experience
  has made me appreciate the small things in life and has encouraged me
  to live and love each day to the fullest”.Caleb is eager to enjoy everything that he enjoyed prior to losing
  his leg. He is fit and adventurous and has always spent his time
  running, hiking, dancing, working out, playing tennis, swimming, and
  joining in all available activities. Caleb has always been dedicated
  to maintaining and improving his health and fitness in a manner beyond
  his years, and still embraces this attitude. He has been inspired to
  reach new heights and is considering the possibility of swimming competitively.After the shark attack, Caleb had many concerns about his ability to
  continue drama. However he has been encouraged by people within the
  industry and is determined to finish what he started. Caleb hopes to
  use this experience to reach and inspire people. He is documenting his
  progress via his community Facebook page and has been interviewed by
  numerous radio stations, newspapers and TV programs. Caleb plans to be
  involved in public speaking for an NSRI educational scheme and other
  similar programs.There are various options as regards a prosthesis, ranging from
  mechanical to fully computerised legs. Caleb is engaging with various
  experts including an occupational therapist, a prosthetist and a
  biokineticist and will consider the options carefully. Ideally, the
  new leg will enable him to participate in the wide range of activities
  he has always enjoyed - and perhaps more! There is a large range in
  price as regards a suitable prosthetic leg. The details will become
  clearer in due course but a realistic target is R1.4 million. Fund
  raising initiatives have been started and this is a hugely

  Morton-Banks and their young son William, were involved in a
  devastating car crash in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  Linette, who was
  driving, received a severe concussion and laceration to her leg. Jason
  received the majority of the vehicle impact; his legs, arm, ribs, and
  sternum were broken, along with extensive internal injuries. Their son
  was miraculously unharmed.It’s been a grueling recovery for Jason and Linette. Jason especially
  will be hospitalized for a very long time, and it is not known when
  either will be able to return to work, or normal day to day life.
  Right now their needs are to get well, come home, and get back to life
  with their son whom they miss so much. We need your help with their
  needs for the future.Jason and Linette will need financial help to pay for transportation
  as their car was completely destroyed in the crash, additional
  childcare, household maintenance, and support for the day to day bills
  that will still accumulate if they are unable to return to work. Our
  goal is to make sure that the stress of recovery is their only concern.This fund will be open long term; you can contribute regularly if you
  are able, but any contribution would be so appreciated.Thank You, and the Morton-Banks Thank You!",Marlena Morton,https://fundrazr.com/anJg1,31%,$20k,$,"6,220",5,Years running,36,"Edmonton, AB, CA",6,15,17,6

Hope for father with huntingtons,"Cathie (46) and Craig (50) Watt are your average Australian family.
  They have two beautiful children.Ten years ago Cathie and Craig were given the horrible news that
  Craig had been diagnosed with Huntingtons disease, an inherited
  disorder that results in death of brain cells.The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental
  abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often
  follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements
  become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until
  coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to
  talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific
  symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between
  30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may
  develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of
  cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with
  symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often
  underestimate the degree of their problems.At this stage Craig is suffering the worst of the symptoms associated
  with huntingtons disease and often struggles with his mobility and
  speech, and has been mistaken for being under the influence of
  alcohol. To explain the disease is laden terms it is though he is
  struggling with Parkinson's, motor neurone disease and Alzheimers.The psychological stress that Cathy has suffered as well as what
  their family is going through is astronomical.There is no cure for this disease although there are trials running
  in China for treatment. The goal is to have Craig there as soon as
  possible, and if anyone could spare as little as $5 it would go a long
  way toward supporting this family to have a better future.The family themselves, including their children do not wish to be
  contact, are not looking for any sympathy, and did not set up this
  page. But as a friend, I know there are a lot of people who care

    could not live with ourselves if we do not support him, and
    therefore we wish to speak the truth and uncover what really
    happened. We also would like to make a documentary, as we

      goal, one vision to dispel the ignorance of the world about what
      sibling abuse in childhood can do to an adult life.My websitehttp://www.hope4siblings.comIn America alone, it is estimated that there are over 40
    million adult sibling abuse survivors. The vast numbers in the world
    can’t be calculated.According to the latest research sibling abuse does have
    lasting, devastating impact with: chronic anxiety, depression, PTSD,
    alcoholism, financial difficulties, addictions, homelessness, poor
    self image, bad relationships, chronic depression and anxiety,
    dysfunctional parenting, involvement in domestic violence, suicide, etc.This beneficial fundraiser is for a nonprofit organization:
    Adult Sibling Abuse Survivors. It will have 3 empowering and
    beneficial components for survivors:1.Comprehensive Education/Information 2. Face-to-Face Support
    Groups, 3. Professionally Staffed 24/7 Helpline, “augmented” with
    Online Message Boards.Adult Sibling Abuse Survivors will start first in Sacramento,
    CA; the vision is to provide affiliates for the United States and
    then the world.Donations will go toward launching for “start up” costs for
    lawyer, filing fees, and a grant writer.Because sibling abuse is substantiated with research to be the
    #1 origin and largest cause of Domestic Violence, Child Abuse,
    Incest, and Bullying, proposals will solicit state and federal funding.You can make a difference in empowering adults whose lives
    have been impacted by sibling abuse. Let’s start! Thank you in

        as well as Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia.These
    things are believed to be as a result of trauma caused by my
    upbringing.I'm currently in a situation where I am verbally abused
        daily by my family. The house I live in is dirty and disgusting.
        I have a large dog named Theo that has been physically abused by
        being kicked in the ribs and hit with a belt by the members of
        this household. There is scarcely food and things to drink in
        the house.I share the house with many adults who
    happen to practice the same negative habits the lead of the house
    does which results in many breakdowns and panic attacks and I need
    to start funding my way out. Not only for my mental health but for
    my animals. Until recently (today, June 7th) I had money put away in
    a safe from working and it was recently stolen while I was away for
    a few days at my boyfriends house. This isn't the first time my
    belongings have been stolen in this household and I don't count on
    it being the last.I plan on taking on a second job in order to try and make
        my way into a safer place soon but for now I need any help I can

For Ethan Kerns in Remembrance of Brian Kerns,"Brian Kerns spent his whole adult life in the military. Brian
    was sent to almost every trouble spot there was to represent our
    country for 20 years. When he retired from active duty he took a
    role leading the ROTC program at ODU.  Brian was looking forward to
    a great life in Virginia Beach.Brain and Lisa did not want to have children while Brain was on
    active duty so they waited until Brian could be home.  Ethan Joseph
    Kerns was born on 05/09/11. He is a wonderful and inquisitive young
    boy.  Brian loved being a father and was very much looking forward
    to his new role.As the saying goes if you want to make God laugh just tell her
    your plans.  While running with his cadets one morning Brian
    collapsed. He never regained consciousness. It was a tragic event
    for his wife, family and friends.  But no one will suffer a greater
    loss than Ethan.  He will not get to experience the incredible love
    that a Father bestows upon his son.  He will not know the blessing
    of having a strong and honorable man as a father.This fund is a small way to at least try and give something back
    to Ethan in Brian's name.  I plan to hand Ethan a check when he
    turns 18 and tell him how great a man his father was to all of us. I
    will help Ethan to make good use of the money as a way to help make
    his life a little better.The fund will be managed by Troy Toner who is a friend and
    trusted financial expert.  With Troy’s expertise and your generosity

  issues in Kenya with some citizens having to walk over 10km before

  clean. Not to mention sometimes up to 3-4 months of the year the water
  is contaminated with the run off of water from the surrounding hills.

Our quest; how to balance parenting & profits,"Meet Ayla, Colin and EllyHi there. We're Colin Clapp and Elly
  McGuinness. And we're proud parents to Ayla.We started our parenting journey at the end
  of 2013 and, like many people we know, we have found it challenging
  balancing all it takes to fulfil all our personal and professional
  desires and responsibilities. But we know we are not alone and there
  are many people experiencing 'work-life balance' challenges.Our causeThe term 'work-life balance' may be a myth to some but in a2017 study reportpublished
        by the UK based charity Working Families evidence suggests
        nearly half the population of working fathers are finding their
        work-life balance increasingly stressful. The report's opening
        statement even says""the UK is runningthe risk of creating a ‘fatherhood penalty’ – as fathers
    consider stalling or side-lining their careers to find roles they
    can better combine with family life.""We are saddened by these findings as we know they are not
      exclusive to the UK or just to dads. So we want to do something
      about it...Regardless of whether you’re a mum or a
  dad, perhaps you may feel you’re experiencing ‘work-life' balance
  challenges of your own? Or perhaps you know a parent who is struggling
  to keep it all together? If so, we feel it’s important people know
  they are not alone.Buteven more importantly,
  we want to find ways to help us all discover and choose alternative paths...Consequently, in 2017 we're on a quest (a
  long and arduous search)to find parents (bothmums and dads)around the world who we (and you) feel are enjoying fulfilling
    parenting relationships while successfully embracing rewarding
    business and professional ventures. And, of course, discovering how
    they are doing it so we can share their wisdom and allow more mums
    and dads to enjoy their parenting journey, instead of enduring it!Why does this matter to us?...In 2016, both Elly and Colin suffered bouts of ‘burnout’ (aka
    the late stages of adrenal fatigue) and the frustrating and often
    debilitating effects that come with it.Nearly all this
  stress can be attributed to the challenges we faced in trying to be
  present as a family while trying to grow our businesses...In our case, we lost all our sources of regular consulting and
    coaching income early in the year, then we couldn't make our online organic grocery business work
    despite selling our house and investing nearly $100k. Although we
    worked tirelessly without reward for nearly 18 months, and tried
    many different tactics to get the business to scale and generate
    some returns, we simply couldn’t get our desiredbusiness model to work.By the end of the year, we both recognised the health and
    happiness of each other, as well asour family relationship with Ayla,was under continuous and growingstress. With no obvious light at the end of our tunnels, we
    eventually reached our breaking point and our own darkest hours in
    October. At this point, we reluctantly admitted a defeat, closed the
    business and sold most of our material possessions. We then left our
    home in the South Island and set off on a one-way journey to
    rejuvenate ourselves and discover a new life and a more purposeful calling.Now three months later, having spent some quality time with
    family, friends and each other, including reminding ourselves about
    enjoying the simple things in life, we can both feel our energies
    and creative spark returning to pre-burnout levels.As such, we have made a renewed commitment to earn our income
    online and follow our desire to live as 'digital nomads’. This means
    we will be able to spend as much time with Ayla as we possibly can.
    Including fulfilling our goal to home educate her in the growing
    ‘worldschooling’ community we recently discovered.We have also decided to start our new life in Southeast Asia. We
    leave New Zealand for Singapore on the 21st February where we will
    stay for two weeks before heading north again (towards Malaysia and
    Thailand) in search of a new place to call home!How we wish to invest the campaign fundsDespite the mix of apprehension and excitement Elly and I are
    currently feeling about our impending venture into the unknown, many
    people have asked us to stay in touch and keep us posted. And while
    that will be nice on a personal level, it won’t help us with our
    wider cause.In order to make our journey meaningful for
  others we want to record our journey via blogs, podcasts and videos.
  We especially feel a podcast will enable us to share the story with
  more people, more easily and more often. Hence the funds are required
  for us to quickly launch a new weekly podcast show that is going to be
  heard as soon as possible by as many people as possible.But setting up and producing a high quality podcast show is not
    something either of us feel we could do without interfering with our
    cause. So this is how and where we wish to spend the campaign funds;Investing in a highly professionalPodcast Launch($5997) and
  ongoingPodcast Editing($8388) Programs
  that will allow us to continually attract guests (parents to
  interview) and listeners to the show.As part of the fundraising campaign, we want you to tell us who you
  feel is enjoying fulfilling parenting relationships and rewarding
  business and professional ventures. Plus we want you to share the
  questions you would like to ask these people. If our campaign is
  successful, we will reach out to as many of these people as possible
  and ask them those questions… (note they don’t have to be celebrities
  or well known people).To start the ball rolling, here are some people we would like to

Have your Cake and Eat it Too! Little Bakery Book,"Hello. I’m Toria, I’m an Anglo-Canadian Medical Herbalist currently
  living in south western France. I’ve been baking since I was a small
  child. I’m an enthusiastic Cook who enjoys the process, and the
  results, of baking.I have also fought with my weight throughout my life.As a healthcare professional for 20 years, I know that ‘you are what
  you eat’ and that too many cakes and sweets are not a good idea. I
  have, at times, struggled to reconcile my love of baking with a
  healthy eating regime. I know that moderation is the key. That’s the
  problem. I can’t do moderation, and I know I’m not alone. When faced
  with cake, I have the willpower of a hungry dog who finds an
  unattended sirloin steak.Eat two forkfuls of hot fudge chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream
  then push the plate away? I don’t think so.How about opening a packet of biscuits, eating one and then putting
  the packet away for another day? No. Can’t do that either. The
  biscuits will only spoil - best eat them when they’re fresh.There is always abstinence...and I can do that...for a while....and
  fruit is good... but sometimes only cake will do.And then I found an answer that works. Of course, one can’t really
  have one’s cake and eat it too, it just feels like it to me!Let me explain:In 2014 I moved to South West France to join my partner in the
  restoration of a wonderful, but derelict, renaissance chateau. It was
  our intention to settle here and develop a Pub and small hotel.Throughout the last 10 years, my partner has invested considerable
  time and money in this project, which was, by now to be completed.
  However, 18 months ago, the property was struck by lightning and my
  partner received a significant blast injury, which ruptured a blood
  vessel in his spine.He was very poorly for some time and, at one point, had a life
  threatening complication. To aid his recuperation, I focussed on
  cooking small, nutrient dense, clean, delicious meals, including tiny
  baked treats.I had an epiphany. For me, tiny works; tiny equals moderation. I can
  eat one or two ‘mouthful’ cakes and be satisfied. I can leave the rest
  of the batch until the next day.I revisited many of my ‘tried and tested’ recipes and reworked them
  to be cleaner, leaner, to have less sugar and more protein and to work
  in small batches. I no longer make 6 dozen cookies (biscuits), I make
  1-2 dozen tiny cookies. I can have my cake and eat it too!Before the lightning strike, we were extremely committed to this
  project. Although my partner is making some sort of a recovery, he can
  stand and walk short distances, the spinal injury is taking
  considerably longer to heal than we can afford. The costs of his care,
  recuperation and just living have consumed the remains of our savings.
  The project has consequently stalled and, sadly, the Chateau has now
  become a stranded asset.Before the incident, my partner was the most enthusiastic, motivated,
  driven person you could wish to meet. He positively fizzed with life.
  Although he is still very driven and expects to recover fully in time,
  the lightning strike has fried his fizz and he’s struggling to see a
  way forward in the short term.Sometimes, as one chapter closes, it is too easy to dwell on the end,
  the loss and it can be all too difficult to see the opening, the
  beginning and the new adventure ahead. Sometimes, the new adventure is
  apparent but the road to it may be obscured.We need to move to a more appropriate location where we will be
  better able to capitalise on our skills and training.This cookbook is
  to help forge that new path.The Have your Cake and Eat it Too! Little Bakery BookThe book will contain 24 core recipes for cakes, cookies, puddings
  and pastries.that can be made quickly, in small batches and
  without the need for fancy equipment or gadgets.These are classic recipes that have been updated to have less sugar,
  more protein and a broad range of micronutrients, whilst maintaining
  the delight of a sweet treat. There are no exotic or difficult to find
  ingredients used.The base recipes create clean simple treats for ‘everyday’ enjoyment
  and will be presented with several variations and with tips and ideas
  for creating more exotic creations for celebrations and entertaining.The recipe list will include the biscuits that my best friend called
  “the best darn oatmeal cookies in the World”. This recipe is so
  versatile; it could fill a whole book on its own.I shall introduce them and some of their variations here, along with
  great chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, sweet tarts and other little
  delights. Several recipes will show the necessary adaptations to make
  vegan or gluten free treats.I’ve chosen the recipes carefully so the book will have a broad
  appeal. The recipes are quick and simple so they are ideal for
  youngsters who are just getting into baking. For more experienced
  bakers, these recipes are great if you’re in a hurry. The book will be
  a handy reference for two dozen family favourites that you will return
  to time and time again.The funds raised by this campaign will be used for:Production costs of the book, including shipping. Contributors will
  receive a personal thank-you from me, as well as their copy of the book.Any proceeds remaining after the production of the book, and from its
  general sale will be used to assist us to relocate to a more
  appropriate location.Please spread the word amongst your friends.If you belong to a community or group which might be interested in
  the Bakery Book project, I can e-mail a poster for your notice boards.Further information and regular updates can be found on my

Help Throw a Kick-Ass 50th Birthday for Catherine!,"Let's throw our dear Catherine Rose an UNFORGETTABLE 50th birthday
  party! She was not going to do this for herself. A few friends and I
  have stepped up to lead, but we can't do it without community support.
  That's where *YOU* come in!!The party is scheduled for Sunday, January 18th. We need donations of
  $ for food and drink. The venue is being donated! We could use help in
  preparing the food and decorating the space (East Bay location.) We
  also need some volunteers for music. Would you like to dj for an hour
  or so? Are you interested in creating a killer playlist for this
  event? Catherine has requested that she receive some wonderful
  bodywork during the event, so we will have a massage table
  available. Would you like to give her body some TLC on her special day?Please only give from your abundance. No money will be collected at
  the door. Now is your chance to contribute and help make this super special.On a different note, Catherine is going through a significant career
  transition. She is in a mode of getting rid of stuff rather than
  acquiring more stuff. Material gifts are not really the thing, with
  only a few exceptions. She does, however, need more support around

Live Like a Monk for 49 Days,"The Tian Men Shan Temple located in Zhangjiajie, China is the ancient
  ancestral Taoist temple on the Shen Wu Lin Chuan style of martial arts
  and is a spiritual centre for the population of Zhangjiajie. During
  the cultural revolution this temple was destroyed and now it lies in
  ruins. Despite this the ruined temple is tended to by Mr Yi who left
  the comfort of the city to live on the mountain and maintain the
  grounds surrounding the temple. Mr Yi chooses to live in a ruined out
  building next to the temple. The temple is close to the heart for both
  locals and students of Shen Wu Lin Chuan. In early 2015 a group of
  students of Shen Wu Lin Chuan raised funds to begin the rebuild and
  took the first lot of funds to China to assist with the renovation.
  Continued fund raising is required to allow a full rebuild to be
  completed. Master Li Zhi Yi of the Shen Wu Lin Chuan is coordinator
  for the project and has said that anyone who contributes to the Temple
  will have their name on a stone tablet placed at the entrance to the
  renovated temple. Become part of history and contribute today.For 49 days I will be abstaining from meat, alcohol, added salt and
  sugar, become celibate and meditate daily (forget one day and start

  stopped.. Apparently a Chevy pickup didn't see them and hit Kam. So
  far they've repaired his pelvis now Neuro wants to keep an eye on his
  skull fracture and the bleeding from his ear which they think could be
  from a ruptured ear drum. I'll know more tomorrow, but the doctors
  said he's really strong and should make a full recovery..The neuro surgeon has told us no permanent brain damage and the skull
  fracture should heal great.. Maybe some hearing issues out of his
  right ear but that should heal too.. Thank you Jesus, i think we're
  out of the woods Now we just need to concentrate on the recovery ahead
  and the rehab to get him up and walking.. This will be tough but over
  the past 12 hours my little soldier showed me what being tough is all

  she is the youngest of our 5 children.  She is an amazingly wonderful
  girl, a truly caring and kind person. The sort of person who would
  give you the shirt off her back if you needed one.   She is always the
  one to step in and help a friend in need.  She has a huge heart and an
  unbelievable love of animals.  One day she hopes to be able to have a
  job rescuing animals.  She has goals, ones that I hope she is able to
  achieve some day.  Once when asked what super hero she would be, she
  said Captain America.   Because he jumped on the grenade to save
  everyone, even when he knew he could die.  My  Emily has had extreme
  anxiety and depression and has been desperately seeking help with
  these issues.  She has been to a residential mental health facility to
  seek help in addition to seeing many therapists and psychiatrists.
   Even with all this help, she still is not without many day to day problems.I’m a big believer that we should repay kindness with kindness. I've
  seen you guys raise $2,000 for a puppy in one evening. I've seen
  $15,000 raised in a week for child refugees. I'm hoping we can raise
  the $ to help a young girl trying to have a good healthy future.  To
  show her that there are people out there that won't hurt her.   So I
  come to you now, selfishly asking you to help a kid who would never
  ask for a thing for herself.EMILY is one of the kindest people I have the pleasure of

  message of encouragement for her. Emily has been failed so many times

  that good people exist. I would like her to know she is amazing just
  for staying so positive and kind through all the bad.   May we all
  live life with a fraction of that.It takes a village to raise a child. Emily is almost no longer
  a child, and she is still in need of a village. Please find it in your
  heart to help one of the sweetest, kind people i have been blessed to
  know. A fully trained dog is quite an expense that our family cannot

The Pancreas on Paws Project,"At the end of the school year in 2014 our eldest daughter Evie fell
  into a coma which we later discovered was from complications of
  undiagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). T1D is an incurable autoimmune
  disease that can not be prevented. T1D caused her body to mistakenly
  attack the islet cells in the pancreas and stopped it from producing
  insulin. Insulin is an important hormone produced by the pancreas that
  allows the body to properly absorb carbohydrates.----------Complications from T1D causes high amounts of glucose in the blood
  called Hyperglycemia and when the glucose in the blood is high too
  often it becomes toxic to the body, producing ketones that that lead
  to Diabetic Keto Acidosis (DKA) which is a potentially dangerous
  condition that can turn into a possibly fatal coma. It's a miracle for
  someone to come out of a DKA coma without other vital organs being
  damaged in the process or even come out alive.---------Another just as serious condition of unregulated glucose is a blood
  sugar low called Hypoglycemia. This can put a T1D sufferer in a
  seizure, unconsciousness and another type of dangerously unresponsive
  coma. Low blood sugar in most cases are a lot scarier as they happen
  within minutes in comparison to days/months of what a blood sugar high
  can do.--------Since her diagnosis it's been a fight to create a sense of normalcy
  in our lives, learning how to test her blood in the morning, before
  all meals and snacks, at bedtime, and before and after all major
  activity. As well as give herself injections of the life saving
  hormone Insulin 4-6  times a day. And although Insulin is saving her
  life everyday it has the potential to be just as dangerous as her
  condition, as it has it's own set of short and long term side affects.
  Some that seriously affect the heart.-----------Besides watching a small child endlessly prick her finger and poke
  her body with needles, the hardest part about this whole process is
  watching our child cope with the realization she's just not normal by
  societies standards. The emotional trauma of missing out on the
  littles things in life because of an unexpected episode of Hyper/Hypoglycemia.----------Two days after she woke from what could've been a fatal DKA coma
  and we brought Evie home from the pediatric ICU, she was lying on our
  kitchen floor trying so hard to cope with the realization that she
  just couldn't go into the fridge, get an apple and just eat it. She
  cried out ""I'd rather die than live like this for the rest of my
  life."" NO CHILD, no person for that matter should have to feel
  that kind of despair and as a parent it was difficult not to lay along
  side her, hold her on that icy kitchen floor and ugly cry our heart out.-----------Two years later and we have adjusted some what to life with Type 1
  Diabetes. It is now what we call our ""New Normal"". We have,
  with what little to no resources and support our community offers,
  creatively coped with this constant battle. But we are far from
  thriving, we are just surviving.----------On the road to thriving with this disease we have kept ourselves
  informed on the latest technologies and treatments for T1D. But none
  seemed as helpful to our family dynamic as the possibility of having a
  Diabetes Alert Dog (D.A.D.). It wasn't till an evening when Evie was
  having a very difficult time going to bed for fear she might not wake
  the next day because of a blood sugar low in the middle of the night,
  that we realized a Diabetes Alert Dog was more than what she wanted,
  it was what she needed.----------Diabetic Alert Dogs are service animals trained to alert diabetic
  owners in advance of blood sugar lows/highs, as early as 45 minutes
  before these episodes become dangerous. With a dog's keen sense of
  smell coupled with their training a D.A.D. dog is able to alert the
  individual or their caregivers to treat these serious and potentially
  fatal conditions. They react to the chemical change produced by blood
  sugar highs and lows and are especially helpful during the the most
  critical times during sleep when it's less likely to be detected by
  the individual.----------Diabetic Alert Dogs have the ability to provide emotional stability
  and wellbeing for individuals and families coping with diabetes. With
  the assistance of a Diabetic Alert Dog the individual and their loved
  ones can lead more confident and independent lifestyle. A life that
  means more than just surviving.--------Having a Diabetic Alert Dog for Evie would be the closest thing to
  salvation until a cure is discovered. In researching D.A.D's we have
  found that training our own dog is the best option to our location and
  our personal needs. So begins the journey to training our own service
  dog and with help that journey beyond surviving and into thriving will
  be a lot less bumpy.",Amanda Young,https://fundrazr.com/pancreasonpaws,27%,$9.3k,$,"2,530",0,days left,38,"Hagåtña, GU",11,11,2,4

      the point of one watches while the other sleeps.Their Mom met their father while she was on location working
        productions in the entertainment industry of New Orleans. When
        the industry fell apart there that year it was hard on a lot of
        people including them.Sue-Lynn became pregnant in November by a man who was in the
        Navy - Special forces. She made the decision to move back to
        Nashville to give the girls a safe upbringing and raise them
        around the music family she had come to love during her time
        here as a struggling artist.The twins father doesn't want to be in the picture and is
        refusing to help the girls in anyway.  He is non-responsive to
        communication.  Her little family of three needs help and a
        sturdy foundation so that our future will be solid.The girls are growing fast and already singing along with
        music scales. They love watching mama play the guitar and drums.Please consider giving what you can so that we can get

Chemo for Grainne and Feed some other Beasts,"Some of you may remember that we had toraise money to help get our dogs Gráinne and Gleann
  diagnosedandthen for Gleann's surgery(which was totally
  successful and which he is recovering from well...still a lot of hair
  to grow back is the only way you'd know he'd been through all
  that)...at that point Gráinne was doing okay.  We really appreciate
  the help, as our financial situation was dire.Gráinne was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As her
  numbers were in a good range and Gleann's issues were so much more
  immediate at the time, we focused on him.Gráinne (racing name Sunset Seduction) is a quirky 7 year-old
  Greyhound who we adopted in the summer of 2014. She has epilepsy,
  which we knew about but it is well controlled. She had one sezure
  since we adopted and they adjusted her medication and she's doing
  well. She's our 6th Greyhound and while most have been somewhat goofy
  she is a contender for most goofy.  She is our first to not want to
  get on the couches and bed.....I mean at all....like she is phobic.
  This might actually be due to her condition or the meds which make her
  a bit clumsy, but she'll lie on her dog bed close to the couch or
  bed.. She can get anxious about things, she does not like routine
  changes, she wants to be near us (even if no couch or bed snuggles),
  She will stand and lean into you while you rub her ears, it's one of
  her favorite things.We knew something was up with her when she started having random
  lumps and joint pain in 2015...not always together. LIke she migth
  have a swelling on her joint and it would cause her pain, but
  sometimes the joint would hurt but no swelling and other times she'd
  have swelling but no signs of pain.  She was checked out for various
  things, then blood work in March of 2016 it showed she had CLL. Her
  numbers were still low, she was showing no signs. And Gleann was
  diagnosed with hyercalcemia which could compromise his life in a short
  time so we focused on his issues.This winter she began showing symptoms and her blood tests showed an
  elevation. Her lymph nodes are swollen now. She's on Prednisone at the
  moment. We need to do further testing, like x-rays and ultrasounds to
  see if her organs are compromised and to look for other indications of
  if the Pred could, possibly at a higher level, beat it back or if it
  would just cause the cancer to become resistant to steroids and she
  needs to be on chemo.We were working to get her in for further evaluations in the next
  couple of weeks. When our already paycheck-to-paycheck situation took
  a sudden nosedive.Last week Aaron fell in the barn and broke his leg.  He's the only
  one working, he is per deim and their seems not assistance at all for
  time lost.  Obviously, as an EMT there is no way he can work a desk
  once he's started healing a bit, he needs to be completely healed and
  have done quite a stretch of Physical Therapy.   I have not been
  employed for a few years. I have been getting my health together, or
  trying, and intended to get back to work, but there are expenses
  involved (classes, certifications and insurance) which I was working
  towards, although now finishing that is impossible with no income.So I am afraid that we are again reaching out. To both get her
  fully evaluated and start chemo (we are also applying for a grant or
  two) and help keep our other animals fed and cared until Aaron is
  literally on his feet again and I can find a job or find some way to
  start my business. The current goal is just a guess...unfortunately,
  it may rise from there....",Saigh Kym Lambert,https://fundrazr.com/chemoforgrainne,69%,$1.4k,$,965,0,days left,25,"Colebrook, NH, US",1,17,20,1

Bring Eugene Home,"Greetings Family and Friends,I am writing to ask your assistance with raising money to cover
  Attorney fees for my Uncle, Eugene Baker. He is my mother’s youngest
  brother who was convicted 31 years ago, of aggravated kidnapping,
  involving family members, in which no deaths or injuries occurred.I was only 16 years old when he was sentenced, and I remember it was
  as if the life was being sucked out of our family because he was such
  a vibrant, integral, part of our family. The favorite Uncle, the
  precocious brother, the consummate helper of those in need, without
  question, he was always there to lend a hand.Eugene has admitted to lapses in judgement, but has consistently
  maintained his innocence. Although some would have given up, Uncle
  Buck (as his nieces and nephews lovingly call him) has remained
  focused, positive and continued to improve himself and those around
  him. He has completed his Bachelors of Arts in Christian Ministry as
  well as the Instructor Certification Training Program for the National
  Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER), which allows
  him to train fellow craft workers, obtaining recognition as a master
  builder, to name a few of his accomplishments.Eugene will be eligible to apply for a clemency hearing in March
  2017, however due to the complexities of Louisiana law, he will be
  best served obtaining an attorney to help prepare for the hearing and
  representing him. Statistics have shown that the chances of the Parole
  Board recommending parole are increased to 90% with attorney
  representation as opposed to 40% without. I truly believe he deserves
  a second chance at freedom and that his stellar time served and
  focused accomplishments, warrant him having yet another opportunity to
  experience life with his family. Eugene is currently 65 years old and
  if he misses this board he can not apply again for another 5 years.The going attorney representation rate for pardon is $10,000.00. The
  funds must be raised by 1 March 2017. I greatly appreciate any
  donation and/or prayers for my Uncle’s release from prison. Also,
  please pass this along to your family and friends to get the word out.
  I know collectively that this can be accomplished for “many hands make
  light work”.On behalf of my Uncle, Eugene Baker and our family, I thank you in
  advance for your prayers and donations.  Thank you for helping us

Raising money for my friend Kanesh & his family.,"Hi, I'm Shameem, (in striped shirt) 21 years old. I'm a student in a
  Medical School in Malaysia and I've created this fund page for a
  friend, a classmate.His name is Kanesh (two from the right) and his dad recently had a
  stroke and i was informed that he did not fully recover from it. He
  doesnt remember well and barely recognize anything anymore. His family
  was already in a financial crisis before the incident as their house
  rent was overdued by a few months. His dad, I believe was the only
  breadwinner of the family as Kanesh lost his mom a few years back.He is the second child out of three. All of which are still studying.
  He doesn't attend classes anymore, which is very unfortunate for
  someone as bright as him. Today, (21st January) he asked the class for
  help to buy few stuff that his family is selling away as their
  landlord forced them to move out. This most recent news is the reason
  for this fundraising. He hadnt been very open about his struggle, and
  it is understandable, so the moment he explained his situations with
  the whole class and asked help to buy the stuff he is selling, I
  believe is his last option. I've only known him for a year and a half
  but i know he is a genuinely kind person and he deserves all the help
  he can get.All this money will go to him and his family, to help with the
    rent of their new place, his dad's medical bill. And most
    importantly, his tuition fee.I've heard tragedies like this happening to people, but never to
  someone so close to me. It made me realize that nothing in life is
  permanent. I really want to help my friend, I dont have money to give,
  so I hope the society would lend a hand.For any further clarification or if you intend on contributing

Team Eric to the Rescue,"THIS IS MEHi my name is Eric Vezeau and I am a 21 years old French Canadian
  from North Bay, Ontario, with deep roots in Cochrane, Ontario. I moved
  to Grande Prairie, Alberta about a year ago for a change of scenery
  and to check out the job market.When I moved here, I bought a truck (as do most Albertans) to get to
  work.  Life was good for a while, but was short-lived once the oil
  sector started to spiral down.  After being let-go from my job, I
  wasn’t ready to throw in the towel, and decided to give the great
  province of Alberta another try by taking a job with a sanitation
  crew. While the work wasn’t very thrilling, the crew was pretty cool
  and fun to hang around with.THE ACCIDENTOn October 13th, 2015, I was cruising down the highway near Grande
  Prairie Alberta with my girlfriend and got into a serious car
  accident. My girlfriend is fine thanks to her seatbelt, but I flew out
  of the truck. Here’s the accident report.http://www.albertapolicereport.ca/2015/10/14/two-injured-in-single-vehicle-rollover-in-highway-43-near-wembley/I was in a coma for almost two weeks.  … I only started to come out
  of it on October 25th and am still fighting for my life at the
  University of Alberta Hospital where I am receiving amazing care.
  Miraculously, the only part of my body that was not impacted seems to
  have been my spine. At the time of posting this campaign, (October
  29th), I could move my left side much more than my right side, and
  could open my eyes and give a “thumbs up” if I liked something.WHY I NEED YOUR HELPThe day following the accident, my mom (Chantal), dad (Claude),
  sister (Stephanie), brother (Marc), grandma (Cecile) flew in from
  Northern Ontario, while my uncle (Dan) flew in from Montreal as they
  were told I may not survive. So far, my family has spent close to
  $15,000 to be by my side, not including the time away from work and
  other loved ones, along with other responsibilities.All of
    these expenses have been out-of-pocket.Some close family
  members and friends have contributed to offset some of these costs
  (Thank you so much), but my family remains in need of more support. My
  mom has advanced MS and limited mobility which presents a challenge in
  terms of finding inexpensive accessible accommodations. Being
  out-of-province also means complicated access to provincial services
  forcompassionate care providers & companions, as
  well as finding temporary housing and adapted transportation. Some
  family members have stayed and continue to stay by my side here in
  Alberta, others have returned to Ontario to work.Also, I have about ONE month left at the U of A Hospital
    followed by several months of rehab.For now, I don’t need
  anything because I am very well taken care of. However, once I’ll be
  in better shape, I will need tons of rehab and not all of it will be

"PLEASE HELP FRANCO, 2-yr old Bulldogger in Chile","Many of my friends know we recently visited Santiago, Chile.  I am
  very fortunate to be able to take trips like this one, which was
  absolutely amazing. The Bulldoggers in Chile are a wonderful community
  and the recent tragedy of a family in the Bulldog Club of Chile really
  touched my heart.This little boy is Franco, who will be TWO years old on November 16,
  2015. He and his parents are part of the Bulldog Club of Chile family,
  and one of his Bulldogs, Benji, is a grandson of my Bentley.Franco is the son ofDeyanira Sotoand Javier Zentino Provoste, andwas severely injured in a serious car accident on September
      13th.Along with Franco in the car accident were his mother and his
  grandmother. While his mother was not hurt physically, his grandmother
  fractured her wrist and tibia.Franco got the worst of it when he went through the
  windshield.  Thank god he was wrapped in a blanket which
  shielded him from even worse injury and ultimately saved his life.His head, ribs and chest were injured in the accident. At first, due
  to the severe internal bleeding on his brain, the doctors thought they
  would have to open his skull to avoid pressure, but it wasn’t
  necessary because the bleeding in his head stopped, thank God.Franco’s ribs and chest would heal, but the main worry continued to
  be his head. This sweet child was in an induced coma until September
  18th, when he was still critical but had become stable. Unfortunately,
  when they brought him out of the coma, Franco’s lungs did not start to
  work, so he is again on a respirator to breathe.Franco opened his eyes, but seemingly without recognizing anyone.  He
  didn’t move, cry, or control his bowels. On September 30th, this sweet
  little baby started to move his eyes and you can tell he now sees –his eyes follow his mother’s every movement.He still does not cry or move anything except his eyes and his arms. 
  He cannot breathe on his own and has been diagnosed with a severe
  spinal injury.Franco has never had it easy, but his life was and continues to be
  filled with love from his family. He was born prematurely and spent
  many days in an incubator, but that is nothing compared to the tragedy
  he and his family are undergoing now.TODAY (October 8, 2015) Franco’s family was given more sad news. They
  already knew he had a diffuse axonal injury(a
    braininjuryin which damage in the form of
    extensive lesions in white matter occurs over a widespread area. DAI
    is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic
    braininjury, and is a major cause of
    unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after head trauma.)Now, the doctors have confirmed that Franco hasa spinal cord
    injury at his neck, which significantly complicates the
  issues.  Very soon, Franco will have a tracheostomy to breathe and a
  gastrostomy for a feeding tube. After this process, his doctors hope
  he will be able to breathe independently from the respirator and can
  be transferred to a hospital with specialty neurological rehabilitation.Franco's father can't be by
  his side in the hospital because he has to work so the family can
  live. The medical expenses are crushing and in order for Franco to get
  the treatment he needs to recover, many more medical expenses will be incurred.We don’t exactly know how much money his family will need to get
  Franco the treatment he will need. He spent the first week in critical
  care, and since then he has been in intensive care. Each day in the
  hospital is very expensive, plus medicine, exams, etc. After all this
  he will (hopefully) need a wheelchair, a special adjustable mattress,
  and rehabilitation.PLEASE consider donating even the smallest amount to help these
  parents help their child.  I was so touched by their love for one
  another - it is just the three of them and this tragedy is
  heartbreaking. I can't imagine the pain of the parents - wanting to
  give Franco the best care imaginable to give him the CHANCE to speak,
  to walk, even to breathe on his own...but able only to do the basics...If we rally together with prayer and donations, I am sure we can make
  a huge difference for this child.#todosconFrancoEvery day at 20:00, please pray for Franco.Thank you!Kara GordonI'm pasting the copy of a post by Franco's mother today.  She wrote
  it in spanish and it's translated here but it's not perfect.""Me pregunto cómo de un día para otro puede cambiar tan
  abruptamente la vida. Como los sueños que tenía se ven derrumbados
  pero suplantados por otros, lejos de los anhelos materiales. El dinero
  hace muchas cosas pero ni con todo el dinero del mundo podría volver a
  recuperar lo que ya perdí. Se que nadie murió, que gracias a Dios
  estamos aún todos aquí, pero la sensación de duelo no puedo quitarmela
  de encima, el recuerdo de mi hijo jugando, pidiendome los brazos para
  que bailaramos juntos o que pasara sus manitos por mi cara para que lo
  besara de la punta de sus deditos recorriendo su antebrazo, dormir
  respirando su aire, su aroma, su risa, su amor por jugar a la pelota,
  la conexión que tenia con los animales, sus besos de agradecimiento,
  su tan desarrollada moticidad fina y su limitado lenguaje... no se
  como explicar lo que se siente, lo único que se que es lo más fuerte
  que me ha tocado vivir, es un dolor desgarrador... Tengo rabia, pena,
  dolor. El único consuelo es la esperanza de que en un futpuro podamos
  estar juntos denuevo, riéndonos y disfrutando de lo natural y de las
  banalidades que nadie ve cuando no se tienen problemas reales.Hijo no importa el tiempo que me tarde, pero voy a dar todo de mi
  para que vuelvas a casa a que disfrutes de todo lo que te gustaba. Se
  que esto tomará mucho tiempo, pero prometo no decaer, voy a estar
  junto a ti todo lo que me resta de vida.Hoy nos dijeron que Franco además de su daño axonal difuso, tiene una
  lesión medular a la altura del cuello, que viene a complicar todo el
  panorama. Muy prontamente se le realizará una traqueostomia para
  respirar y una gastrostomia para poder alimentarse. Luego de este
  proceso y cuando alcance la estabilidad e independencia del ventilador
  mecánico, será trasladado a algún hospital con especialidad de
  rehabilitación neurológica.Gracias a todos los que han estado en todo momento y disculpen si no
  contestamos llamadas, pero de vez en cuando solo queremos descansar....I wonder how from one day to another can change so abruptly life.

  already lost. Is that no one died, we thank god we're all still here,
  but the feeling of grief I can't take it off of me, the memory of my
  son playing, asking the arms so that we just danced together or to
  spend their little hands on my face for it Kissed the tip of your
  fingers coursing through his forearm, sleeping breathing his air, its
  aroma, her laugh, her love for playing the ball, the connection I had
  with animals, their kisses of gratitude, your so developed moticidad
  fine and his Limited language... I don't know how to explain what it
  feels like, the only thing is that it is the strongest that has
  touched me live, it's a pain that is heartbreaking... I have anger,
  sorrow, pain. The only consolation is the hope that in a futpuro can
  be together again, laughing and enjoying the natural and the
  platitudes that nobody sees you when you don't have real
  problems. Son, no matter the time that I'm late, but I'm going to give
  all of me to come home to you to enjoy everything that you liked. I
  know that this will take a long time, but I promise I won't fall, I'll
  be with you all that remains of my life.Today we were told that Franco in addition to its diffuse axonal
  injury, he has a spinal cord injury to the height of the neck, which
  comes to complicate the whole picture. Very soon he will make a
  traqueostomia to breathe and a gastrostomia in order to be able to
  feed. After this process and when it reaches the stability and
  independence of the fan mechanic, will be transferred to a hospital
  with specialty neurological rehabilitation.Thanks to all those who have been at all times and I'm sorry if we
  don't answer calls, but once in a while we just want to rest....""",Kara Gordon,https://fundrazr.com/7137N5,16%,$10k,$,"1,645",3,Years running,26,"Pirque, Santiago Metropolitan Region, CL",10,9,17,4
Let's get Anastasia back up on her feet,"Anastasia and her kids need our help. They were part of a terrible
  car accident which has left  both of Anastasia's feet shattered and
  her little girl suffering multiple spinal injuries.She will not be able to bear weight on her feet for months. Her
  daughter will also be recovering from fractures on cervical, thoracic
  and lumbar vertabrae, a broken clavicle, torn and stretched ligaments,
  and cranial nerve palsy to boot which is causing her double vision.
  Her son broke part of his hand in the accident also.As hard as these days of being apart from her children will be, with
  so much pain ahead, the future must seem overwhelming for her.A widowed, single mother of 2, she was struggling to make ends meet.
  She decided to go back to school after her husband died. She figured
  she'd sacrifice in the short term in order to have better longer term
  prospects. She worked hard for several years and JUST graduated from a
  2 year program, with an RMT designation. She had a job interview
  scheduled for the day after the accident.Everyone is trying to figure out next steps and determine what
  resources will be available, but what we do know is Anastasia will
  need A LOT of help - delivering and/or preparing meals, keeping the
  fridge stocked, housekeeping, driving the family to appointments,
  running errands, helping take care of the childrenAnd on top of all of that, there is the mortgage and bills that still
  need to be paid.The most incredible thing?  Her first day in hospital, she
  was posting pictures of rainbows from her hospital bed. She is always
  seeing the good in people and in situations.  I don’t want to ever see
  that amazing optimism be quashed.All help is greatly appreciated.Here is news footage about the
  accident, so you can have a better understanding of the damage.",Christina Kakaletris,https://fundrazr.com/b124oe,62%,$20k,$,"12,342",4,Years running,118,"Durham, ON, CA",8,17,21,0
Wheels for Brian Sullivan,"When my brother was 12, he was in an accident and as a result
  suffered a traumatic brain injury and is now wheelchair bound.  My
  mother and father dedicated their lives to taking care of him from
  that moment on and have sacrificed everything to ensure his health and
  happiness. My father would work around the clock to bring in money to
  support the family while my mom basically became a home health care
  giver overnight. With the passing of my father unexpectedly at age 52
  a few years ago, my mom was left to take care of an adult handicap
  child on her own with no income coming in. She does this daily with a
  smile on her face and a positive attitude for my brother Brian.  She
  is a proud, strong, and selfless woman who does not like to accept
  help from anyone but deserves it more than anyone I know.  My
  brother's current handicap accessible van is up for inspection and
  will not pass because of its wear and tear over the years.  In order
  to feel safe transporting Brian around and so she can just get to the
  grocery store and back, she is in need of a new one. Since devoting
  her life to taking care of Brian so he can live at home and have the
  best life she can give him under the circumstances, she is unable to
  work and therefore has no way of purchasing a new vehicle. I created
  this site in hopes that we can raise funds to help her with this
  significant financial purchase that is a necessity for her and Brian.
  I love them with all of my heart and if I could purchase one for them
  on my own, I would, but we need your help.  Any small donation would
  be extremely helpful :) Thank you for your time. Kelly",Kelly Sullivan,https://fundrazr.com/013Frc,53%,$20k,$,"10,665",3,Years running,97,"Oak Bluffs, MA, US",10,8,14,3
Please help loving father be a part of son's life.,"Maxx was born in February 2016.  When he came into the world he made
  my best friend, Edward English, the father he has wanted to be since
  the day I met him back in 2001; working at a West Virginia Bob Evans.Ed is the kind of person who, moves back home to Louisianna, changes
  his career, and uproots his life, to help his family.  Because, that's
  what you do.  You stick by your family.Recently, Ed has had to fight to be a part of his son's life.  While
  working full-time to help take care of his special needs foster
  siblings, Ed didn't have much time to date.  So, when he fell in love
  it was exciting.  He became engaged and immediately made plans to move
  her and her son into his home.  When they found out she was pregnant
  he was over the moon!  He began rennovations on his house. 
  Unfortunatley, things have changed and Ed has had to fight tooth and
  nail for every second with Maxx.  He will never give up the fight, but
  it will take it's toll.  I hope through this campaign, we can give Ed
  some peace of mind knowing he can be a part of his son's life.  He is
  in the process of having the home appraised so he can borrow against
  it. My dream is to be able to keep that from happening.Every dollar raised will go directly to Ed's mounting legal fees. 
  There are many fathers who would give up and walk away from their
  children.  Maxx has an amazing father who is ready and willing to give
  him all the love and care in the world.  We are forever grateful for

Help Me Help My Son :),"My name is Anthony and this is my son Ryan. I haven't been able to
  spend very much time with him in his life (because of the initial
  custody agreement that was arranged).After the divorce, I spent time working and going to school in
  different states (Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Tennessee). As a result, until
  recently I was unable to consider myself in a stable enough
  environment to provide more than just child support for him. Now that
  I have the stability my son needs, I am actively working to make
  changes to that custody agreement. Not only have I remarried but I am
  now in a place where I am working on ventures I once considered only dreams.I want Ryan in my life more and I have done everything I can and will
  continue to do so. Unfortunately as much as I love my son and want him
  in my life now, the timing has been really hard and the finances (to
  go through the process to gain half custody) are high and are required

  and common law is no longer in effect in Ohio, what she has done in

  went to the courthouse  in an attempt to establish my parental rights.
  I am now in a ridiculously expensive court battle to bring him home.
  One that I just can't afford, and can't afford to give up on either. I

Partners 2014 Grad Party!!,"Dear Fellows,As you all know, the Partners class of 2014 is getting ready to
  graduate!! ELC is right around the corner, and we are so excited to
  have been selected to participate in this rigorous and selective
  program, and even happier to be joining the ranks of Fellows in the
  very near future.We have a wonderful graduation party planned for Monday night,
  October 27. As you may or may not know, we are unable to use the
  Woodlands as the facility where the party is hosted this year. While
  that's a bummer, we haven't let that slow us down at all. As a class,
  we have selected a venue close to the Williamsburg conference facility
  and hotels, but not on the property itself. Our venue will be The
  Trellis (http://www.thetrellis.com/). We will be providing
  beer and wine, hors d'oeuvres, a special themed cocktail, themed
  decorations, music, indoor and outdoor areas and activities, and
  transportation on a continuous loop between the Lodge, the Trellis,
  and the Woodlands. Every class member has agreed to our starting
  budget and is assisting with this event to ensure it is great.We know that, in the past, the Partners hosting graduation have
  provided a ""tip jar"" at the party itself. Because we are
  having to pay for and provide transportation as well as many other
  items up front, however, we are hoping to crowdsource the same type of
  event donationspriorto the event itself. Our budget here is
  the key: the more we know we have, the more we can offer. So, we
  decided to do a virtual pre-event passing of the proverbial hat. If
  you are so inclined (no pressure!), we would be incredibly grateful
  for any funds you can contribute so that we can continue improving the
  awesome event we have planned and can offer more and better libations
  and food.So - in what is now an infamous first Partners 2014 offsite
  catch-phrase, ""What say you?""Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you all at The Trellis.

More than Many Sparrows,"My name is Peter, and I am centre leader for the charity,Friends International, in Oxford.Friends International aims to encourage end equip churches and
  Christian Unions around the country to reach out to international
  students with the love of Christ.Like migrant birds returning to Africa for the winter, or the
  Arctic for the summer, international students come to this country for
  such a short time, but it is a time that can really change their lives.'Ruby', from Vietnam, came to know Jesus for herself just last year
  when she encountered Christians for the first time. She was moved by
  the way Christians treated her and soon came to trust in Christ herself.Now Ruby is spending a year with Friends International in Oxford,
  helping other students who, like her, are far from home. As part of
  this year, we would like her to participate in thePhilip Project, an initiative designed to equip
  international students to return home with the knowledge and skills to
  communicate the Christian faith in other cultures.Vietnam is often regarded as a 'closed' country to the Gospel, and so
  returning as a Christian will be a challenge. The more training and
  discipleship Ruby can receive while she is here with us, the deeper
  her roots in Christ will grow so that she can go on to bear much fruit
  on her return.Many of you will know that earlier this year I had major heart
      surgery which has taken months for me to recover from. Indeed, I
      am still far from being back to full strength. In order to
      do something both challangeing and fun to celebrate Friends
      International's 30th anniversary, and to mark my return to
      work after surgery, I am going to do a SPONSORED BIRDWATCH (!) to
      raise funds for Ruby's training and transport costs.How does it work?Choosing a dry, still day 20th to 22nd October (to be postponed if
  bad weather persists), I will be up with the lark and trying to find
  and identify as many species of birds as possible in
  Oxfordshire before the day's end.Experience suggests that finding about 50 species is possible,which
  is also about the same number of nationalities of students we have had
  contact with at Oxford Brookes University where I serve as
  International Chaplain. Participants can sponsor me an amount
  per species seen, and I will publish a list of birds alongside a list
  of nationalities, soyou can pick your favourite bird and pray
    for students from that country!With my bone condition and residual pain and tiredness from the
  operation, spending up to 12 hours on my feet, and walking a
  reasonable distance) on my feet carrying 6kg of optical equipment will
  be challenging enough (albeit unashamedly enjoyable!).So, time is ticking, it is migration season! Let's make the most of
  the short time Ruby is with us to invest in her life in a way that can
  touch her community for Christ back in Vietnam.What to do nowIf you would like to contribute to this, you can (a) follow the links
  and contribute a fixed amount, or (b) send us an email (teaglesnest@gmail.com) to pledge an amount per
  species seen(e.g. a contribution of 50p per bird species will
    likely raise enough fortransport costsfor one month's training).Many blessings and thanksPeter, Lynette and the FIOx team",Peter Teagle,https://fundrazr.com/c139kb,142%,£600,£,854,0,days left,13,"Oxford, England, GB",10,7,18,2

"""Going Back!"" - Tonga Mission Trip","For years, Golan Singers has had a consistent desire to serve as
  missionaries. In November of 2009, we came upon a near-death
  experience. At age 36, Pila was diagnosed with valley fever by doctors
  and was told that he would never fully recover. He was, also, told
  that he would have to use an oxygen tank for the rest of his life. It
  was only by God’s divine intervention that a family friend, who
  happened to be a Naturopathic Doctor, came to his rescue. We witnessed
  the wonders of God’s mighty works, as He healed Pila through natural
  means. Consequently, we began to sincerely study His Word, and, in
  return, our lives were never again the same.Accepting the Lord’s calling, we (2 families) left Arizona on August
  28, 2011 to serve as missionaries in West Virginia at Miracle Meadows
  School (MMS), an alternative school for kids with at-risk behaviors.
  We left everything, including the characteristic life we were used to
  living, behind. After serving for almost 3 years at MMS, we moved to
  Ministry of Health in Nebraska. Serving in this ministry takes us back
  to the very object of our journey. We cannot help but be confirmed in
  our conviction of the availability and efficacy of God’s healing hands
  upon the sick.After many years in the United States, we are heading back to our
  mother country, Tonga, in the South Pacific for a two-month mission
  trip to be taken towards the end of this year, 2015. We endeavor to
  share our testimonies with our people, letting them know how faithful
  God has been to us thus far. We will, moreover, be sharing the health
  message, Pillars of our faith, practical techniques of evangelism, the
  importance of prayer, present truth songs, and last but not the least,
  the last four things that Mrs. White admonished us to study,
  especially in the last days (The Sanctuary, The 2300 Days Prophecy,
  The Commandments of God, and The Testimonies of Jesus). We’re praying
  that we’ll engage mostly with young people who may be looking for ways
  to finish God’s work.We solicit your prayers and, should God tap on your heart to help us
  with donations, they will be greatly appreciated. If by any chance,
  you’ve been longing to be a missionary worker, or to be a part of a
  missionary activity, but circumstances have not allowed you, here’s
  your chance to help with whatever the Lord impresses you to give. All
  donations will be used to finance our entire trip, as well as to
  purchase the material we will need for the programs. Most of our
  prepared programs are translated into our native language (Tongan) to
  help our locals understand the presentations we will be making. We
  thank you for allowing God to speak to your hearts as you prayerfully
  remember us in your personal devotions and worship hours.Matthew 28:19, 20 – “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
  baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the
  Holy Ghost:Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
  commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the

Somerset Fire Back on Your Feet Fund for Autumn,"***An anonymous donor agreed to cover all fees associated with the
  payment processing so that every dollar you donate goes to Autumn***A four alarm fire struck Somerset West this morning, destroying many
  well loved local businesses like The Daily Grind, as well as the
  apartment building at Percy & Somerset.Our friend and co-worker Autumn lived right on the corner, and we
  rushed over as soon as we heard about the blaze. As the smoke cleared
  we saw that the roof had collapsed, utterly destroying his apartment.Like many of us Autumn lives on a limited income, and donates what
  little extra cash and time he has to progressive causes. Autumn
  doesn't have home insurance, and has lost literally everything. But,
  its not the material items that matter.Autumn's cat Moon, a gorgeous crotchety old broad of a cat has died
  in the fire. Moon entered Autumn's life over 15 years ago. They met
  when Autumn was a teen and Moon has been there through every rough
  patch Autumn has faced growing up. To not have Moon here to offer
  comfort during this crisis is devastating.If you have any spare cash, or items to donate please
    consider doing so.As someone who has had to live on Ontario Disability in the past,
  Autumn would be the first to say that no one should feel guilty for
  not being able to donate. Like so many of us Autumn knows what it is
  like to be scratching by and unable to donate to causes you care
  about. If you aren't able to donate please consider sending your best
  wishes his way or sharing the pitch. For material donations locally,
  please message Ash.

  really did lose a lot to today's (October 21) fire back on his feet by
  hopefully raising enough money to get him the basics and to hopefully
  help a few other people that were effected by the fire. Fortunately he
  doesn't have a story like others' that have lost hundreds of thousands
  of dollars worth of equipment and he didn't have any animals but it
  doesn't diminish the fact that he and his roommate lost memories and
  property that, unfortunately, will never come back.I hope, not only for my friend's sake but for everyone involved in
  the fire that the generosity and compassion of others' extends itself
  to an entire community. Let's stay strong and prove that we can all

Please help us pay ..Self Defense case of Kendall,"Behind every fact is a story. Allow me toshare the story of
        Kendall Rachard Thompson, a 23 old black male who was raised by
        a single mother in North Carolina. Kendall was determined to
        beat the odds and not become a statistic . He successfully
        graduated from Northwest Guildford High School in Greensboro,
        NC. After high school, he attended Guilford Technical Community
        College (GTCC) to pursue a degree in Entertainment Technology
        while working for High Point University. He is currently in his
        last semester and was on target to graduate , December 2016.
        Kendall has always had a strong faith in God and it was this
        faith that led him to discover his gift and passion for sound
        and lights while volunteering at his local church. Kendall’s
        love for people and his community lead him to cultivate his
        desire and entrepreneur spirit to start a sound and light
        business . As well as , to pursue a career in Law Enforcement.
        However , on February 23, 2016, his life changed forever!
        Kendall was enjoying the comforts of his home while playing
        video games when a knock on the door spiraled into his current
        reality . Kendall was attacked by two strangers brought to his
        home by a person he believed to be his friend. Kendall was
        forced to defend himself. Due to the pending ongoing case, we
        cannot go into the specific details of the case. Kendall has
        been place on suspension from work pending the outcome of his
        case. His case was recently moved from District to Superior
        Court . This change has forced us to come up with a large amount
        of money byMonday, October 10, 2016. One could not
        have planned for this. We are believing God for a financial
        miracle. We are asking that you find it in your heart to donate
        any amount. No amount is too small. We pray the God blesses each
        of you tremendously for your sacrificial and monetary gifts .

Bring Kevin Home to his Family!,"Please help bring Kevin Home!Kevin New is my husband. We have been together several
            years and have a four year old son and share an 8 year old
            daughter with her mother, Kristi. Kevin and I have been like
            most married couples: we laughed and cried and worked and
            argued and prayed and struggled and celebrated. Kevin is a
            well knownhome re-modelerin the Chattanooga area and was valued for his
            uncompromising high quality work and high integrity. He was
            the hardest working man I have ever known. He was also, like
            the rest of us, wounded by lifeand he struggled with depression most of his life.A few months ago my beautiful husband finally agreed to
            get treatment for his depression!! Within a few weeks there
            was a noticeable difference and life in our home became peaceful and
            Kevin admitted that he felt true happiness for the first
            time in his life. That bliss was short lived. Things began
            to change incrementally. He began to drink more and more and
            more. His behavior was erratic and sometimes frightening.
            But, when you are in the middle of it you cannot see the
            forest for the trees. We didn't really understand the storm
            that was already swirling around us. Finally, Kevin told his
            doctor about the changes in his behavior and mental statusand his medication was immediately changed in the hope
            for better results. Two weeks later he was inconsolable,
            unreasonable, unrecognizable and suicidal. When I called the
            police after his suicide threat asking them to check on him,
            he greeted the officers with gunfire.As all of Kevin's friends, family and associates will
            attest, his behavior is proof that he was in the midst of a
            mental breakdown, probably induced by the medication he was
            prescribed.Kevin would never, ever, EVER do something like that to a
            police officer. It is not something he is wired to do. No WAY!We need your help. His attorney fees are more than any
            of us can afford. Kevin's mother has arranged to make the
            down payment but, that will only be the beginning and has
            basically already been used and we are back in the hole
            before the check clears. Additionally, there are expenses in
            our household that have become difficult to meet so some
            funds will be diverted,ifneeded, for unexpected household or health expenses for
            my home or our stepdaughter's home.Kevin's attorney has been very clear. Kevin could spend
            the rest of his life in jail without proper defense. Kevin
            is a fine member of this community, he is kind and decent,
            hard working and loving, a good provider for his family and
            his children. He is loving and generous and a friend to so
            many. Leaving this man in jail for months or even years
            would be a tragedy far greater than already experienced.
            Please help us bring Kevin home. Please help us keep our
            family together. Please help us prevent Kevin's children
            from growing up without their father. Anyhelp you can give would be so much appreciated. Thank
            you for making it this far. God bless you!!http://www.wdef.com/2016/09/09/sale-creek-swat-standoff-suspect-faces-attempted-murder-charges/",Shannon New,https://fundrazr.com/f1B3wf,1%,$25k,$,240,2,Years running,5,"Chattanooga, TN, US",10,26,20,2
Officer Down!!!!,"Arshad (Razz) Razzak was a San Francisco Police officer for 19 years.
  I have had the honor, and the pleasure of being his friend since about
  2006. Never in my life have I met a more courageous, compassionate and
  ethical man. He truly gave his all for SFPD, to keep San Francisco safe.Razz was wrongfully convicted in a Federal trial, resulting from an
  entry into a room at the Henry Hotel on 12/23/2010.He and his partners went there because he had knowledge that a large
  drug deal was about to go down. The two officers he tasked with
  ""freezing"" that room (to prevent anyone from entering or
  exiting) messed up, and entered the room instead. Razz, being down the
  hall with his back turned... did not see what they did. These two
  officers later told Razz that they had ""knocked and noticed""
  (knocking and getting permission from the occupants) to enter. That is
  what Razz wrote in his police report.Then the San Francisco Public Defender's office obtained video from
  the hotel, apparently contradicting what Razz wrote in his report. All
  Hell broke loose.For political reasons, SFPD passed the investigation off to the
  District Attorney, who in turn passed it off to the FBI. The two
  officers who messed up...lied to a Federal Grand Jury, in exchange for
  immunity from prosecution. They said Razz ORDERED them to go in.The rest is history. Horrible, unjust... a tragedy. Razz was
  convicted of violating that occupant's civil rights, and for lying on
  his police report.Yesterday was Razz' sentencing hearing, and my dearest friend was
  sentenced to 14 months in Federal Custody. He is scheduled to turn
  himself in on December 2nd. 2016---less than 3 months from now. His
  family is devastated. Razz has a wife, a son, a daughter and his
  disabled mother all living with him, and totally dependent upon him.Shockingly the judge also ordered Razz to pay over $12,000.00 in
  fines, as well!!!Since his conviction, Razz was forced to resign from SFPD. He has
  been working 15-18 hour days as a taxi driver, trying desperately to
  feed his family and make his mortgage payments. He hasn't had anything
  extra to put into savings...and what will become of his family when he
  is not able to work at all???Let's all come together and help this fine man and his family. If you
  work as a police officer, just remember that the same thing could
  happen to you, at any time. If you are not a police officer, please
  think about how Razz put his life on the line every day for 19 years
  to protect the good people of San Francisco.Razz and his family need us right now. Please join me in helping to
  ensure his beautiful family has a roof over their heads, and food on
  the table.Teri Seagoteri4740@gmail.com",Teri Seago,https://fundrazr.com/01A4J5,18%,$50k,$,"9,190",0,days left,57,"San Francisco, US",9,1,3,3
"Help Wronged Mom, Jill Seminaris!","Help us Fight an Unfair Landmark ruling regarding Custody.My name is Jill, & I’m a single mother to two beautiful
      children: a daughter, T.,(aged 13) and a son, G.,(aged 10). My
      daughter is a child of a relationship I had before I was married,
      and my son is a child of the marriage between my ex-husband and
      I.In September 2003, there was a child support order created, at
      which point, I and Nicklos Vessey were named the parents of T..
      When my ex-husband and I divorced, she was not added to the
      dissolution paperwork, and thus has never been recognized as a
      child of the marriage. I have continued to allow my daughter and
      ex-husband to enjoy a relationship, as I have always believed it
      was beneficial to her. Since my daughter was not a child of the
      marriage between my ex-husband and I, there were never any custody
      orders made for her. Informally, I supported the relationship she
      built with my ex-husband, and she enjoyed knowing him as “Dad.”Our son, naturally, was listed on the dissolution paperwork as
      a child of the marriage, and a formal ruling of custody and
      visitation was made in January 2010. The ruling gave me Sole
      Primary custody and my ex and I shared legal custody of our son.My children and I each have bilateral, sensorineural hearing
      loss which can be described as mild-to-moderate. I did not choose
      to wear hearing aids until I was 17 years old. My children and I
      each have hearing aids, but my daughter had chosen not to wear
      them to school this past year during 7th grade. My son chooses not
      to wear them at home most of the time, and I also choose, at
      times, not to wear them at home. It has always been my position
      that if my children were happy, socially well-adjusted, and
      performed academically well in school, I would not force them to
      wear hearing aids if they would rather not wear them. My
      ex-husband feels staunchly that my children should wear them at
      all times (other than obviously permissible times when one
      wouldn’t wear them: bathing, sleeping, etc). Both of my children
      have enjoyed healthy and robust social lives; there has never been
      any reason to believe that my children are suffering for not
      wearing hearing aids. Yet, this issue was hotly contested during
      our custody battle.After a difficult and nasty year-long custody battle, I have
      recently had the heartbreaking experience of being stripped of my
      custodial rights because a judge found that my permissive attitude
      toward my children wearing hearing aids is “medically neglectful,”
      even though they have always obtained good grades in school (3.0
      or better) even without hearing aids, and there is no evidence
      that NOT wearing the hearing aids is a detriment to either of my
      children. The judge said that since my children and I don’t speak
      ASL, we aren’t true members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
      Community, and therefore, I don’t have the right to choose what
      kind of experience my children have. (AS IF, right?!) To say the
      very least, I’m offended. For any person who hears fully to deny
      us our right to NOT hear is patently unconstitutional. For a judge
      to tell me that because I don't speak ASL, I don't have a true
      language barrier or right that needs protecting is beyond unfair,
      and he ripped my children away from me over one weekend because he
      has a negative opinion.My ex-husband was, on Friday 8/19/2016, named a “presumed
      parent” of my daughter and awarded FULL physical and legal custody
      of my daughter and of our son, absent a showing a clear and
      convincing evidence that removing either child from my custody is
      in their best interests. Who would take a 13-year old girl away
      from her mother, simply because her mother didn’t force her to
      have an experience she didn’t want? Without wearing her hearing
      aids, my daughter was accepted into Advanced Choir and achieved a
      3.7 GPA. To say that I’m heartbroken is an understatement. I feel
      like my constitutional rights to parent and raise my children in a
      way that I feel is appropriately sensitive has been grossly
      violated. Most importantly, this issue has serious implications
      for parents everywhere who live a less conventional lifestyle
      (Amish, LGBT), Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing parents, disabled parents and
      anyone who may have a claim to “presumed parenthood.” This is a
      dangerous precedent for the public to accept, and will have
      far-reaching consequences if it is not reversed.Please help me appeal this unfair ruling!!If you can help by donating any amount possible, I will be so gratefulSincerely and Hopefully Yours,Jill SeminarisHelp us Fight an Unfair Landmark ruling regarding Custody.My name is Jill, & I’m a single mother to two beautiful

      have an experience she didn’t want? Without wearing her hearing
      aids, my daughter was accepted into Advanced Choir and achieved a
      3.7 GPA. To say that I’m heartbroken is an understatement. I feel
      like my constitutional rights to parent and raise my children in a
      way that I feel is appropriately sensitive has been grossly
      violated. Most importantly, this issue has serious implications
      for parents everywhere who live a less conventional lifestyle
      (Amish, LGBT), Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing parents, disabled parents and
      anyone who may have a claim to “presumed parenthood.” This is a
      dangerous precedent for the public to accept, and will have
      far-reaching consequences if it is not reversed.Please help me appeal this unfair ruling!!If you can help by donating any amount possible, my family and

Gabi's fond,"Hi, I am Sara, Gabi's mommy.Gabi is 7 year old little girl who just got diagnosed with terrible
  and fatal neurodegenerative disease, called Batten's disease.She was healthy child, reaching all her milestones until age of 4,
  when she got epilepsy. Many AEDs but seizures got worse and worse.
  Then she started to loose functions. One by one. She already lost her
  sight and her ability to walk, but it's gonna be so much worse. She
  will be bedridden and without any function, until vital ones get
  affected. Her lifespam is between age 8-12.There is no cure or treatment, there isn't anything we can do, except
  make her life as beautiful as we can.She has one little (but financialy big for us) wish. She wants to go
  visit Santa Clause town in Finland. We want to take her this November,
  because we don't know how much time she has, and when she will be ina
  stage that is impossible to travel. That's why we need help. We don't
  have time to save money, we need help from familly and friends, to
  make her wish come true. Because she deserve it. This three years were
  all in hospital stays, doctors appointments, tests and she already
  lost a big part of her childhood, and disease will take even more.

Baby J's New Beginning!,"Hello all.  I am the grandmother of this adorable little angel Jack
  William Virgin IV.  We fondly refer to him as Jack-Jack.  He was born
  July 3, 2015.He is the victim of violent abuse at the hands of his own mother all
  before 2 months of age.I have started this page to try and raise funds for my son and
  grandson to assist with medical bills, diapers, formula and any other
  needs this newly single dad may have.Here's a little bit about his injuries:Jack-Jack was hospitalized on September 5, 2015 at Rockford Memorial
  Hospital for what we thought was an intestinal problem.  He had been
  unable to consistently keep formula and pedialyte down for 2-3 weeks.Thanks to an observant hospitalist, Dr. Stephen Pichler, who noticed
  his head measurements were larger than what they should be, he ordered
  at CT Scan of his head. We were then informed of Jack-Jack's
  head injuries.  He stated there was 2 areas of bleeding/injury that
  were consistent with abuse.  These injuries were of different ages,
  one was 3-4 weeks old and the other was 2-3 days old.  They then did a
  full body xray and found he also had a fractured rib.  We are so
  grateful to Dr. Pichler... I know he saved my grandson's life.With the help of DCFS and the Belvidere Police Department conducting
  their own investigation, his mother, Breeanna Watt, confessed to
  throwing Jack-Jack on the hardwood floor causing him to lose
  consciousness for up to 3 minutes, throwing him down on the couch,
  smothering his face in the couch to stop him from crying and lastly
  squeezing his torso and arm to teach him a lesson so, he'll think
  about it, the next time he cries.  And this is all before he reached
  the age of 2 months.She is now sitting in the Boone County Jail facing 3 (three)Class X
  Felonies and 1 (one) Class 3 Felony.  Here is theNewspaper Articlerelated to her arrest.My son has an Order of Protection in place and is filing a petition
  for full custody.  He has been working very few hours due to caring
  for his son and can use any and all donations to help this newly
  single dad give Jack-Jack a new beginning.",Tera Richter-Virgin,https://fundrazr.com/012rMf,10%,$5k,$,510,4,Years running,10,"Belvidere, US",9,20,16,6

John Snow's Peg Leg,"Im starting a fund raiser for the vet bills for my nephews dog.This is John Snow.He was hit by a truck and needs a leg amputed. If we cant raise the
  money he will have to be put down.He's still young and strong
  and comes from a long line of dogs bred by my sister to be guards,
  companions and workmates in the interior of British Columbia.His heritage is sled dog, wolf, German Shepard and border collie.
  So he is especially suited to his environment and has great
  potential.My sister has owned and bred his line for three
  generations and hoped to continue with him when.he was old enough and
  finished his training but this accident has made that future uncertain.What happened;Around 9:30 at night our legacy dog John Snow McKay was hit in his
  rear by the front of someones light colored truck. The person driving
  sped away while we ran up the driveway to see what made such a
  horrible sound.It happenned on Horsefly Landing Road.Snow is only 2 years 2 months. He is the keeper in a line of
  keepers going back as long as the humans in the clan.His grandmother Keisha(husky malamute sled dog from Faro in the
  Yukon territory and his mother Ishia(wolf/husky/shepard/border collie
  from central b.c.) ran over to see what happened.When I got there he
  looked so much like Fritz, the patenal grandfather dog that had also
  been a part of our clan that I had a weird moment of dejavu.The great Fritz is the one that started it all, he was a huge
  beautiful creature that was loyal and loving and smart. He came from a
  line of Prince george cop dogs and joined our clan in 1999. He was a
  good companion and a good workmate.He patroled the horsefly property keeping away the critters
  that would bother his humans in the most noble way. He gave puppies to
  Kiesha three times.Their pups got their great size and character from their father
  and the smarts from their mother.So another member entered the clan.Boo. He was the male pup that showed the most potential from the
  final litter.Chosen for his dark coloring and loving nature.When old Fritz came to the end of his shift another trooper was
  needed. Thats where Ishia joined us. She was bred with Boo and their
  similar heritage made their puppies strong, smart, loyal and capable.Snow was chosen for his ferocious bark and gentle soul. When the
  time comes he will bring even more companions to our family with yet
  another carefully selected female.We are hoping to keep this tradition going for many generations to
  come and as any of the other families that have taken a pup from this
  bunch can tell you these dogs make great companions.I'll put up more photos and add more details soon. Please feel free
  to ask questions and share this with any animal lovers you know.Our family thanks all that help, read or share this and will return
  any kindness however we can.",Jenn Why,https://fundrazr.com/712yW6,27%,$2k,$,535,4,Years running,8,"San Diego, US",9,26,21,5
The very Best for Baby Bailey,"As most of you know on Thursday 8/11/16 Bailey's father made false
  allegations and filed an order of protection keeping my daughter from
  me. The papers do allow me to see my daughter when my mother is
  present so we have her during the day for now.  Brian and I lived
  together and he worked while i stayed home and cared for bailey and
  the house. Even when returning from work he was not involved in
  Baileys day to day care. He has done this out of anger and knows that
  this isnt whats best for her. She is four months old and has not been
  apart from her mommy since birth. my sweet baby girl is under the care
  of a man who just doesnt know what hes doing. He has had to ask about
  her medicine, her formula, her doctor, he doesnt know any of these
  things and is also not very patient. He typically only takes her when
  she is happy and hands her back over once she fusses. I dont doubt
  that Brian can keep her alive but she needs to be with her mommy to
  thrive. As a mother I of course worry about every little thing about
  her care. The pain of being without her is indescribable. Suffocating
  is the only word that even comes close. As any mother can imagine I am
  in utter despair. He's not even keeping her schedule so shes cranky
  and having a tough time. Her whole tiny little world has been turned
  upside down and although she isnt feeling the sting of this like I am,
  this needs resolution fast. Not only is it shocking that a judge
  allowed this, but they scheduled the court date out to 9/20/16. This
  uis unacceptable on the part of her father and the court system, but
  this is where we are. We did meet with an attorned who stated that the
  Judge who granted this is unreasonably biased toward fathers. We are
  scheduled to see a different judge, but not until the 20th. The
  attorney wants to file an order to show cause which will get us in
  front of the judge sooner so we can plead our case. We are looking to
  get another opinion as her retainer was quite high. Although it seems
  Brian doesnt have a leg to stand on, I cant trust the legal system, so
  I want to secure an attorney to ensure my daughter gets back to me. My
  mother and her husband are my lifeline right now, and I want to do
  whatever it takes for my daughter, but I dont want the burden to fall
  completely on them. I have no idea how long or difficult this will be
  to fight. All of you have been so supportive and we appreciate you
  standing in the gap for us in prayer! We are encouraged and clinging
  to God in this. Many of you have expressed a helplessness and desire
  to help in any way possible, so we have created an outlet for anyone
  who feels called to give to this cause for attorney fees and other
  unforseeable expenses. Please pray about this and only give if you
  feel called to do so. For those of you who are unable or who dont feel
  called to give please still lift this up in prayer. Continue to go to
  war for us spiritually. We will be posting updates, photos, victories,
  and prayer request to keep everyone informed who is supporting us! We
  are truly so grateful for encouragements, prayers, and well wishes in

  brought in for questioning. After several grueling hours of being

  Wellington has been an upstanding prisoner, he has worked in the legal
  department helping fellow prisoners file petitions regarding their
  cases,he has also worked in the administration department assisting

Adoption Fundraiser,"Thank you for taking the time read our story. Through our journey to
  become parents we have endured several miscarriages, 8 infertility
  treatments (IVF, FET and IUI's), hundreds of injections and
  medications, failed adoption and foster care attempts. We have
  exhausted all financial options trying to build our family from credit
  cards, retirement accounts and loans for infertility treatments. We
  are thankful for our son from our 5th infertility treatment. We went
  on to endure 3 more unsuccessful treatments to try to give him a
  sibling. We gave up on Infertility treatments and adoption attempts
  and sold most of our baby items to move on from the pain. My husband
  is in the Air Force and amidst our current relocation we received a
  phone call that turned our world upside down. A friend that I
  previously worked with in a pregnancy office had a patient who was
  looking for a family to adopt her baby, she told her our story of what
  we had been through and referred her to us. We had just been
  considering adopting once we moved and felt like this was a Godsend to
  us. We cannot have children on our own and someone is wanting to give
  us a baby. Due to the circumstances we were not prepared to get a
  phone call to adopt in the middle of our move and were not prepared
  for the outrageous cost of private adoption. We have been assured that
  if something were to happen and things did not work out with this
  birth mother, then the funds we have paid will be put towards a future
  more costly adoption. We understand if you are not able to donate if
  you could just keep us and the birth mother in your prayers. Please
  spread the word to help us bring this baby home! **Update** Baby Ava
  was born on October 20th and is in our care under a legal risk
  placement until the adoption is finalized.  We have paid over $8,000
  and are still needing to raise money for additional legal costs and
  agency fees. Please help us to reach our goals to finalize placement.

Help move our mobile home before it's demolished,"Help us move our mobile home before it's demolished on
      November 1st.We are finally seeing a light at the end of a long dark tunnel . My
  brother and I have been through more heartache and pain then most will
  ever endure during one lifetime. We were raised by heroin addicted
  parents and our family life was anything but normal or happy. We lost
  our sister Heather, my beloved twin, in a house fire. The trauma took
  its toll on my brother and I causing ongoing PTSD for both of us. Then
  shortly after the tragedy, we lost our mother to suicide on Christmas
  eve because of her overwhelming guilt in losing one of her children.
  We have been having a hard time for many years struggling to afford
  even the basics. Last year we became homeless. We could no longer
  afford rent and basic living expenses. My brother Paul is suffering
  from extreme anxiety and I have health issues with fibromyalgia. We
  are both on SSI right now but the money isn’t enough to put a roof
  over our heads. We have been living in our car and sometimes,
  gratefully, on the sofas of understanding friends. The good news is,
  our church found a free mobile home that will be available to us until
  November 1st. (If we can have it moved by then) we have found a mobile
  home park where it will only cost us $300.00per
  month in space rent. Unfortunately, the cost to move it and connect it
  to electricity, water and sewage is$3000.00which we don’t have. I don't know how else to
  get it moved and a friend suggested we try a fundraising page.
  Honestly this is our only hope. With your donations, we hope to get
  the money we need to finally have a home we can afford and stop being
  homeless. Any donation is welcome. Any donation amount will help, even
  as little as $5.00(the cost of 1 non-fat latte), we
  would be able get our home moved and have a chance at getting our
  lives together. We have been living in our car and leaning on our
  friends for help but we want to be able to pull out of this and put
  our lives in order. We would greatly appreciate any help offered and
  want to Thank You for taking the time to read this. If you cannot
  afford to help will you please share. Warm Holidays and God bless everyone.""",GoddessMelania Love,https://fundrazr.com/Dreamsdocometrue,5%,$2k,$,100,2,Years running,1,"Seattle, WA, US",10,26,7,2

SHHHH! giant cat painting needed for Leigh's 30th!,"THIS IS A 30TH BDAY SURPRISE!!! First and Foremost!!!!Years ago our beloved friend Leigh fell in love with this giant
  4'-0"" tall x 5'-0"" wide giant cat painting at a friend's
  apartment party (see below)We recently discovered an identical painting on craigslist for $200
  in New Jersey. We realize some people may think $200 is a ridiculous
  amount for a giant painting of a cat, but let's face it Leigh will
  love it (and it is perfect timing for her 30th birthday on October
  1st). Since this is a pretty ridiculous gift, none of us really want
  to spend a ton of money on it, but let's just say the purchase has
  been secured in advance. We thought this was a perfect opportunity for
  everyone to chip in a little cash to help Leigh realize her dream of
  owning this painting. We are assuming $80 should cover the cost of a
  zip car to pick up this bad boy. Just in case you aren't sure you
  should contribute $5, $10 or $20 to this cause, take a look at how
  awesome this thing is again.This
  will be presented to Leigh on her birthday with all of your notes and
  comments below. Please obviously refrain from posting this on any kind
  of social media if possible. Thanks for your help and being such

Daughter & wife medical cost and flooding,"Hi everyone I started this fundrazr in September and I
        have learned a lot about so many things from our government and
        Obamacare to learning what depression really is. this week is it
        for us our phones get cut off , power gets cut off , cable and
        internet get cut off , car tags past due , insurance past due.When people ask me what this has been like to go thru this
        year my answer is ;imagine being chained to a pole and in front of you is any
        money you have as well as anything you own of value like my
        tools I need to work and make a living .  Then doctors , labs ,
        specialist all come and take what you have and their is nothing
        you can do about it except watch it happen but also now you are
        wondering how is my family going to eat ? how is the power bill
        being paid ? and so on. No matter what you do all you can do is
        watch .one thing I haven't said much about is my wife and what
        she has gone thru . When the twins were born she ended up having
        a lot of medical problems , she has had her thyroid removed ,
        gallbladder removed and when my daughter got sick she stopped
        getting her lad work done to keep her thyroid regulalated
        because she saw I was already working 24/7 and their was no
        money for her $1500 lab work on top of my daughters stuff she
        has gained over 80 pounds , she has been to the Er 3 times this
        year they have had to stop her heart 2 times for 10 seconds to
        reset it each time and blood transfusions for being anemic. She
        just had her lab work done last week it had been over 14 months
        . She has been thru hell she sacrificed her self for my daughter
        and our family all the while  with being anemic and thyroid so
        far out of whack still taking care of the kids every day she
        can't help the weight gain she has no metabolism ,  that is out
        of her control it has hurt her mentally and physically and she
        still has fought through it and I cannot thank her enough and I
        cannot tell her I love her enough , me and her just got blue
        cross blue shield which starts Jan 1 and she will finally
        herself be able to get the medical care she needs.i have 4 children twins that just turned 6 , 8 yr old son and
        my 14 yr old daughter and me and my wife will be married 18
        years in July . We started my shop 8 years ago after I went thru
        15 months of prostate treatments the main reason I agreed to
        start a shop on my property is I finally wanted to run a shop
        the correct way not based around the all mighty dollar and car
        repair is second. We started in the dirt not even a roof but
         within a year I turned a old carport into my one bay shop .  
        At that point we set goals get a mortgage in four years to build
        a real shop and move our trailer next to it.  Once the flooding
        started it ruined everything no more mortgage and we had to
        continue working out of that one bay shop or the driveway .
         Working out of a one-day shop limit your income whatever car
        you're working on that your income you don't have the ability to
        start too many jobs there's no space to do it , so the one car
        in the shop  and the one on the driveway is your income for the
        week and hopefully you're not waiting on parts also not having a
        lift makes of jobs take twice as long and dangerous .  I
        should've listen to people and went to the news when the county
        and city caused the flooding on our property but I truly
        believed that they would not leave us like this I could not
        fathom a county and city doing this to a family and their
        business but I was wrong and they Did.  But even all that being
        said my twins being born premature my boy Luke his lungs
        collapsing going without the proper oxygen for 30 hours rush to
        the nick you with chest tubes put in them for three weeks ,
         living with developmental issues that he has my wife having her
        thyroid out for years ago and all the medical expenses that we
        had even before my daughter got sick ,  we had no problem paying
        it all and keeping 7 to 9000 in the bank . Inhave worked 7 days
        a week 12 plus hours a day sense day 1. When she got sick we
        simply thought  it was just a stomach infection of some type ,
        this started last December , by the end of January the  nausea
        throwing up diarrhea stomach cramps fever headaches had been
        going on over a month and now we are being sent to so many
        specialist , labs , scans and test one after another.when I went thru my prostate  episode we had Medicaid medipass
        and I have to say it wasn't bad at all. Then Obamacare was
        coming into effect we no longer had madicade medipas and the
        deadline was approaching  my wife contacted two insurance agents
        we tried to get  normal insurance but we could not so we had no
        choice to file for Obamacare  or face a fine that would be taken
        from our taxes .  We were given stay well insurance we had no
        idea anything about it , up until my daughter got sick we knew
        that we pay for everything for me and my wife , the pediatrician
         was the only one who did file stay well insurance .  Here is a
        excellent example about stay well insurance so I don't have to
        write a mile long paragraph because as y'all can tell I am not
        good at writing my son just turned six the beginning of
        September when he was five  he climbed a 7 foot tower fell off
        and broke his arm my wife took him to the ER ,  The ER doctor
        was very nice the x-ray showed he broke both bones in his arm an
        inch away from his wrist they put them in a temporary cast and
        said to make an appointment with the orthopedic doctor in five
        days when the swelling goes down to get his permanent cast all
        the material was sent to them like x-rays  my wife called to
        make the appointment they told my wife sorry we do not take stay
        well have a nice day and they hung up .  We live in a relatively
        small town there is not orthopedic doctors in every corner we
        were talking a bout a five-year-old child with two broken bones
        in his arm in a temporary cast with nowhere to go and they
        refused to see him because of stay well .  They did not care
        what happen to a five-year-old child with two broken bones so
        much for the doctors oath .  So I called and talked to the lady
        she told me if they filed 10 stay well claims that day they
        would only get paid for three and they would only get paid a
        couple dollars and they would spend their time fighting stay
        well .  So I asked her why didn't they recommend my wife paying
        cash she had no answer the reason is because they assume you're
        on stay well they assume you're poor . I was told by stay well
        and a drs office this year that they were not in the business of
        'caring'. And look at it this way a dr has the legal right to
        refuse any insurance per Obamacare so now they are getting paid
        cash and the dr is no longer paying someone to file claims for
        staywell . Seems like a win for staywell not having to pay and a
        win for the dr getting cash full price all at once. But now my
        wife had to call all family and friends to find a orthopedic dr
        who will either take payments or at a cash discount. And a
        simple task of making a appointment turns into a nightmare.
        That's how it's been this whole year with my daughter.here is what my daughter has gone thru a quick summary. First
        beginning of last year she was  diagnosed with Chiari
        malformation a brain and spine disease which the Nero surgeon
        told us at Shands that it was stage one and not progressing but
        now we believe that this is what's causing everything and it is
        progressing she had a 5 cm hole in her brainstem .1. Started getting sick December 15  nausea throwing up
        diarrhea stomach cramps headaches dizziness and so on.2.  From January to July was a nightmare of trying to see a
        specialist get lab work done testing medication and so on3. July first surgery  her gallbladder was infected and
        stopped working appendix and two moles .4.  About 30 days after her surgery they redid her lab work
        and found out now her thyroid wasn't working ,   It took over
        three months and my mom's  Indo chronologist   Seeing her just
        to get her started on Synthroid and getting her thyroid
        regulated because of stay well insurance .5.  She missed 2 1/2 months of school last year and over 2 1/2
        months this year6.  The nausea throwing up diarrhea stomach cramps I have not
        stopped since December sometimes it gets better might be better
        for a month then it goes back to full blown  having accidents
        everywhere in school in the car at home in stores7.  She is sad crazy lab work results from food poisoning to
        staff infection to E. coli8.  Two weeks ago we found out yet another new thing they say
        that she has a bad bulging disc in her back even though she's
        never injured her back they are trying to figure out what to do
        about that9.  The Dentist says that she has a problem with her teeth
        that he only sees in young children10.  She has lost over 25 poundsThis is stuff that made-for-TV movies are made of it is from
        one extreme to the next , she is only 14 and has had 3 organs
        fail in one year , female issues and now bulging disc in her
        back she just recently also had chest pain and other things .
         And it's your daughter you can't just say OK I'm not spending
        no more money on you you just have to put your faith in the
        doctors and do what they say ,  but to lose everything because
        of medical and county flooding us that is too hard to except and
        to comprehend our government made this  Insurance that doctors
        hate where is the organization that oversees this insurance
        company why is it that if somebody is on disability they get
        prestige  Insurance and all doctors take that ?  Selling my
        tools to survive is unbearable my tools on my livelihood the
        only tools I have left now are the basic tools that I need to
        work everything else was sold for penny's on the dollar .Here at my shop I have helped so many people when  members of
        a church called me to help with a cancer patients car I do it
        when they call for me to help a single mom I do it , when a
        person stops by  and says he or she lost there job  and their
        vehicle broke down so they can't find the new one I help them
        out .  I have helped people and organizations out so much that
        my friends and family have told me I have to stop even this year
        I still have helped many people and what's hard to except his
        win the same people  tell me sorry we can't help you but a
        couple days later they called back and want me to do more for
        them  I am not saying that I did anything for anybody and now
        they owe me I am just saying I have learned an awful lot this
        year and a lot of it is not good .  I have never been big on
        social media and a lot of people told me that if I just had
        Facebook friends I could probably get help for my family and my
        business .  I thought I knew what depression was but this year I
        have learned the true meaning of depression it is like an evil
        force that takes over your body and mind and ruines you 24 hours
        a day and there's nothing you can do about it breaking down in
        public bad things happening left and right last month my wife's
        car broke down 2 times mine broke down 1 time .The water damage has ruined our trailer several rooms we walk
        on 2x4s because the floors are falling in , but we can't repair
        any of it , we have no stove , no dishwasher ""not needed'
        just saying , only one batheroom works ""  which makes it
        very hard when my daughter can stay in the bathroom for 12 hours
        ' ,  only one door closes which is the front door  ,  our church
        just had people come and spend a day repairing the roof because
        the trailer has sunk so bad from the flooding that it's tore way
        the roof ,  my shop floor the concrete has crumbled in the
        sinking to the point you can only have a very small light
        vehicle in the shop . We've lost eBay because I couldn't pay the
        monthly bill ,  and that was our second main source of income ,
         we tried to get business loans months ago and actually got
        approved but then we were told we didn't put enough money in the
        bank the past three months to get funded .  My credit that I
        work so hard on is being ruined now ,  and this is all because
        my 14-year-old daughter got sick and we had so much medical
        expenses as well as the flooding .  I don't know what to do or
        say to get people to help us I have a car that I can sell I owe
        money on it but it still worth more than what I/O I've already
        try to sell it on eBay in the past2004 Mercedes s55 AMG 104k miles RennTech upgradesWe have had yard sales we have done everything go thing that
        we can I can't take on every job because I don't have the money
        for parts or tools I have a very successful business ,  this has
        nothing to do with the business for us this is simply paying out
        4 to 12 times our monthly income each month.  When you're paying
        that much money out each month it is impossible for anybody not
        to go broke but when it's your child you cannot stop you have to
        put your faith in the doctors and do what they say there is no
        longer any such thing as free medical at least not here .If somebody could help us with the loan or an investor on
        eBay on the top rated power seller that I really need to fix
        before it's ruined for good I have a very successful business
        except we're stuck working out of one day because of the county
        in the flooding ,  and this week our phones are being cut off

Charles' Mission Trip To Jamacia,"Dear Donor:How are you doing? I hope that God is doing as many wonderful things
  in your life as He is in mine! This past year of my life has been full
  of spiritual growth opportunities. I have been in constant prayer
  seeking to discover what God’s purpose is for my life.I want to share with you a challenging ministry opportunity that God
  has presented to me. During the week of Thanksgiving this year
  (November 21- November 28), God has presented me with an opportunity
  to travel to parts of Jamaica with a Mission group from One Community
  Church. On this missions trip we will be sharing the love of Christ to
  the people of Jamaica. Did you know that in Jamaica one out of every
  six people survive off of one dollar a day? It’s been placed on our
  hearts to go and lend a helping hand. We hope to meet the physical,
  emotional and spiritual needs there by serving in local schools,
  churches, orphanages and building a house for a family in need. You
  probably already know that I have a passion for building the esteem of
  youth and young adults.  I’m more than elated to be able to spend time
  teaching and sharing with the youth and young adults of Jamaica,
  helping them in any way possible.While God has opened up a door for me to develop a greater heart of
  compassion for His people around the world, the exciting part is that
  you will be able to share in this compassion in several ways. The
  First way you can help is to be in constantPRAYERfor my teammates and I. Please pray that God will prepare us for this
  mission trip and bless our efforts as we minister to the people of
  Jamaica. You can also pray that our financial needs will be met. I
  will need to raise $2,500 to attend this trip, and that is quite a challenge!Another way you can help is to be involved by providing financial
  support. Would you consider supporting me with a donation?I will need
  to raise all my funds by November 3, 2015.Now whether you feel led to contribute financially, through prayer,
  or both, I greatly appreciate whatever you can give!  I am so honored
  to be a part of something so beautiful that advances the Kingdom of
  God! I cannot wait to see how Christ will grow our faith, deepen our
  relationship with Him and touch the hearts of those we meet!I look forward to doing God's work in Jamaica and letting you know
  all about how God has worked through this team when I return in November.It's All About Christ,Charles Terry Jr.",Charles Terry,https://fundrazr.com/311JU3,4%,$2.5k,$,100,4,Years running,4,"Dallas, TX, US",7,20,6,0

  Victory House Church that next Sunday morning. He and our dear friend,
  Pastor Nick Koopalethes, will then fly out that night and arrive in
  Swansea on the 10th. They will be able to help in any preparatory work
  that needs to be done before SHINE explodes on Thursday the 13th.Although Michael has been given time off, this trip is again
    “leave without pay” and so we are asking for partners to help cover
    the cost of the trip, plus the 7 days of work he will be missing!We will also be only 6 weeks in to having added a little boy to our

    leave the Fundrazr page open till August for friends who wanted to
    contribute later in the summer and so that folks can get updates of
    what God is doing in our lives on this incredible journey.*******************************************************************************************Important Notice to USA friends:Our Fundrazr

  allows us to start our ""perks"" at a specific minimum amount.
   However, the first perk, a card printed with one of Alice's original
  paintings and a handwritten note of thanks on the inside, will be sent
  to all of our supporters regardless of the amount given.  Pease select
  another groovy perk corresponding to the various amounts as well.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------God is so good to us. This first year of marriage has been an
    exciting journey following the Father together and seeing Him meet
    all our needs.Today, April 28th is our 7 month
  anniversary!  God has given us a lovely little flat right on the
  border between Hong Kong and Mainland China where we are building a
  life together.  We even have a spare bedroom for guests, which is not
  to be taken for granted here in space-crunched Hong Kong.  (If you are
  passing through Hong Kong and need a place to crash, hit us up. ;-D)
   We are truly thankful for all our friends around the world and all
  the support, love and prayer that has been sent our way.  Hugs,
  prayers and blessings back to all of you!Back To School!This has been a glorious season of
  exploring life together as a married couple.  We are deepening in what
  it means to enjoy God’s love and shed that love abroad with our lives,
  callings, giftings and hearts intertwined as one.To that end,
    we want to follow as God leads us to attend a 3 month ministry
    school together called Cana New Wine Seminary from the 2nd of June
    to the 9th of August, 2015 in Portland, Oregon, USA.We
  want to go deeper and higher in our understanding of supernatural
  ministry, the finished work of the cross and the mind-blowing life and
  love of the Father, Son and Spirit.  The summer includes intensive
  teaching by world class theologians and proven ministers.  We will
  also be hitting the streets of Portland with the message to practice
  what has been preached. God is madly in love with this crazy world and
  He inspires, equips and gifts His children to embrace and invite
  others into that love.  That's what this summer will be all about. You
  can learn more about the summer seminary course here:http://www.cana.co/Course_Curriculum.htmlSome friends have expressed a wish to help with the financial
    cost of pursuing our dream.After praying about it, we
  want to share our dream with our wider network. We know that God loves
  to fund the causes of His Kingdom through the generosity of His
  people, and in turn rain down a blessing on generous givers.The cost for the summer is$68,300HKD  (or $8,838USD).The cost breakdown is as follows:Travel costs to Portland for two:  $14,500HKDTution for two and books:  $40,300HKDHousing in Portand for the summer: $13,500HKD(All costs are given in Hong Kong Dollars. $1 USDollar equals $7.75

  and plan to continue doing everything they can to be responsible in
  funding this dream though savings, the proceeds of Mike's tutorial
  business and Alice's painting workshops, as well as Mike working side
  jobs while in the USA.  However, as God calls us to grow and
  inititates us into the ways of His Kingdom, we are often called to
  ""step out on the water"" by faith and see God meet our need
  as we reach out past what our natural human resources alone would
  permit. This is a faith venture and we are excited knowing that Father
  delights to provide.  God is the giver of dreams and the fulfiller of
  visions.  Thank you Father for your overwhelming love!Would you please help in the following three ways:Pray and believe with us in God's abundant provision and blessing.As Holy Spirit leads you, please click the orange

  everyone was always happy. That is, except for one grumpy troll. No
  one liked the troll who was bossy and always serious, but the princess
  was kind and one day invited the troll to go on an adventure with her.As they wandered, she began to see that the grumpy troll
  everyone knew was actually very kind, silly and smart. As they stood
  under the stars, they shared true loves first kiss and the grumpy
  troll was transformed into a prince himself.Months passed, but their love never faded. In front of the
  greatest castle in the land, under the starry sky, the prince wrapped
  around the princess and asked her to be his, now and forever. She
  agreed, and the two lived happily ever after.. That is, until they got
  the wedding bill.""~~~Me and my amazing fiancee met while working on the

  couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the first time we met I

  was revealed that I was right since she thought I was a ""bossy jerk.""Fate worked it's magic though and we ended up going to EPCOT

Spinal Cord & Traumatic Brain Injury Family Fund,"I would like to first of all Introduce myself. My name is Shelly and
  my husbands name is Arild. We have been married for over 10 years and
  live in Kansas.I am taking us back to January 31, 2014, a day that was not like any
  other. One that had changed our lives and took away our dreams, our
  lives, and everything we had ever hoped for. While at work my husband
  was electrocuted by a live power line and was blown off of and fell 16
  feet to a concrete landing. He suffered life threatning injuries which
  has left him today liveing the life of a Parapelgic with Brain Damage.After spending 17 days in a Coma, and nearly 7 months of Bed Sores,
  Pneumonias, Infection in the bone due to a bed sore, numerous Skin
  Grafts, Major Back Surgery, still even then more Surgeries, Hospital
  after Hospital, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Rehab Facilities he was
  finally able to come home.He was released with an infection in his cocynx (tailbone) due to a
  bed sore. Bed ridden for more than 8 weeks here at home. I was giving
  him antibiotics twice a day everyday through an IV. After the wound
  vac was removed from his cocynx he began Physical Thereapy and
  Occupational Therapy againg. They started helping him transfer from
  bed to chair again. He had lost about 80% of his upper body strength
  so it was like starting all over again. With bouts of pnuemonia,
  blockage in the bowels, and so many other symptoms that required
  around the clock care he was so frustrated and let down by his life's
  situation that he as Arild would say it ""there is no light at the
  end of the tunnel"".To this day he spends every day and night in his hospital bed where
  he sleeps in our living room in our home. He is able to tolerate
  getting up and being transferred out of bed for medical appointments
  and sitting in his wheelchair for 4 - 6hours at a time. . The pain in
  his back is unbearable for him on most given days. The Spinal Cord
  injury was so severe that he requires total care.That is where I come into the picture. His wife and his caregiver
  Shelly. Watching how this once strong, active, determined, full of
  life man lowered to having everything done for him and never leaving
  the house is tough to watch let alone stay positive for him. This
  accident has taken control of  both of our lives and taken
  our ivelihood away from us.During all of this I have been working from motel rooms and finally
  from home. With the exception of the first 5-6 weeks after the
  accident when my mind was consumed by what had happened and trying to
  picture where this is taking us. In July of this year I was faced with
  my own health has been suffering since the beginning of all of this. I
  had to try and stay focused on work to keep the money coming in and
  yet still take care for my husband at the same time from home. Due to
  my own health and our home situation I ended up giving up my job to
  stay at home and care for my husband.  At least I knew he could not be
  left alone so that I could work. The choice was not easy. Arild has
  not worked for almost two years and now with the decision that I had
  to make we would be without income. I have learned that government
  programs offer very very little assistance. Respite care they could
  give me 2-6 hours a week. SSI he nor we were eligible for, medical
  assistance I am still waiting to hear on that. I lost Arilds health
  insurance several months ago simply because when there is no income
  $534.00/monthly is a lot of money. The initial Social Security
  disability I applied for him was denied.Arild still has many medical needs that are not being taken care
  because their is no health insurance and no income. There are 4 or
  more surgeries that we know of in the very near future that just have
  to be done. Arild is losing sight in his right eye due to the
  electrocution, still has torn left rotator cuff that may need to be
  repaired, excess skin hangs over his right eye that needs to be
  reconstructed, dental because his teeth cracked at the time of the
  fall, needs an indwelling catheter instead of the foley, that would
  reduce the urinary tract infections. The accident was almost 22 months
  ago and their is still critical medical needs to be met.He is left to cope daily with depression, no self esteem, being in
  constant pain in his fingertips, agonizing back and shoulder pain,
  mentally trying to accept the fact that he will never be able to walk
  again, write, draw, read, drive, run errands, work, wash his own hair,
  dress himself, concentrate, , etc. almost all of what we do and take
  for granted everyday.Any funding we would recieve would go towards paying our debt that
  we have accumulated here such as rent, utilities, past and present
  medical expenses and future housing costs, medical and transportation,
  medical insurance, etc. that would enable us to start over. My plan is
  to move back up to the area where our families are living. It is a
  very long 10 hour drive from where we are now. I have no help or
  assistance with Arild down here and the quality of his life well, the
  quality of our lives would be so much healthier and stronger
  surrounded by those we Love and Know. My hope is to go to Nursing
  School. I was worked in the Nursing field for more than 15 years and
  always wanted to become an RN. Well now I really have a good reason to
  do that. We do not have many connections in Kansas and since the
  accident our whole lives have been turned upside and inside out. We
  need a place to belong and people we know so that the quality of both
  of our lives can improve.Eventhough Arilds daily medical needs and personal cares will not
  change I still have the expenses of prescription mediciation, general
  health and personal health care supplies. Since his accident and
  becoming a parapelgic I have learned that caring for the skin to
  prevent breakdowns, skin and urine infections, overall general health
  is dealt with so much differently.In all honesty the amount of time that I spend in fearing the
  unknown, financial responsiblities that we cannot possibly meet, etc.
  and trying to hold back and act like there is nothing really so wrong
  that we cant fix it when in reality, This ""we cannot fix"".I have to do everything I can do to make this, our lives better. We
  cannot possibly go on like we have. I wake up in fear everyday of what
  is going to be taken away from us today or what will we lose today.I am asking for financial help and support so that we can move
  forward with our lives. We cannot get past and over this horrible time
  in our lives unless something changes. I know and still believe that
  by the Grace of God there is a way to be just content in our lives. I
  just cant do this alone anymore. If you can help me with any financial
  support and encouragement I could sure use it right now.I will keep you updated with what any support you can give us will do
  for us. You will be forever appreciated and we will be forever in your debt.Thank you for taking the time to read our story and understanding.

Please help young mother in need of support,"WHO AM I & WHAT IS MY STORY?Hello, My Name is Marielle Carlos,I'm 21 years old and pregnant with my
  first child. I'm currently residing in the Philippines, but grew up in
  Sydney, Australia. However, due to living in Australia on a student
  visa since I was 4 years old, I was never able to acquire a residency
  in Australia because I was living with my Aunty and Uncle, and my
  parents and siblings lived in the Philippines. The immigration
  wouldn't allow me to obtain a Permanent residency because my parents
  were Filipino Citizens. My Aunty and Uncle tried to adopt me when I
  was 4 years old, but weren't successful in doing so, because
  immigration told them it was not allowed because my parents were still
  alive and healthy. They tried to tell them that they weren't
  financially able to raise me, and that my dad was taking drugs, but
  unfortunately immigration denied them. We tried many many different
  ways to try and get me a PR in Australia, but the only thing
  immigration said was to keep studying, and eventually get a job and
  sponsorship, but figured that reapplying for a student visa whenever
  it run out was far too costly for us.All my life, I lived with my Aunty and
  Uncle, and would stay with my Nana every weekend until I turned the
  age of 13 and permanently decided to move in with her.Growing up I'd say I was lucky enough to
  have a good upbringing, and in 2013, when My Nana passed away, she had
  left me with a generous gift, and I was only able to receive it fully
  when I turned 21 years old. The only problem was, once she passed
  away, I was able to also receive weekly allowances and extra money for
  living expenses and also paid for my courses at TAFE which I failed to
  finish due to my suffering from the loss of the person who meant the
  world to me.In 2014, I moved to the Philippines to
  reunite with my family (mum, dad, siblings), only to be greeted with
  the bad news that my own Father was in Jail. I went to visit him for
  the first time in 2014, and bought him some groceries and food and
  also gave him money. (Jail over here is different)I did not however expect that during my
  time of living here, I would be taking out extra money from my
  inheritance and spending it on my family. I didn't think that I would
  be supporting everybody, from my parents, to siblings to occasionally
  Aunty and grandparents. I didn't think that I would be the weight
  bearer, and literally pay for all expenses, which include college fees
  for both my sister and I, school supplies for my siblings, weekly
  allowances for my siblings, money daily for my mum, medical, rent,
  bills, food & groceries & buying furniture and other
  necessities that we needed or my family needed.The biggest mistake I made was not taking
  note of how much money I was withdrawing from my inheritance, the gift
  my Nana gave me, was meant for me and my future for after I was 21
  years old. However, being young and always thinking about everyone
  else but myself, I gave most of it to my family. Nobody in my family
  ever tried to help me or even bothered to find work and pay for
  themselves. They were all and still are to this day dependant on me
  even when they know I have nothing more to give to them.In 2014, my grandma over here let me live
  in her house in an area in Mabalacat, if I was to fix it. Because I
  trusted her with my heart, I spent roughly 5,000 AUD on renovating the
  place and then buying furniture that I needed to live. Only for her to
  kick me and my family out of her house because she didn't like the
  people I lived with, which resorted in us having to move to another place.I was also supporting my brother and his
  girlfriend, and paying for their babies expenses and needs. I was
  taken advantage of during the past 4 years of having lived here in the
  Philippines. In 2015, my life turned downhill when my brother started
  taking Ice, and started stealing from me. The first thing he stole
  were my speakers, my iPhone, and then later on in 2015, broke into the
  apartment I was currently renting and ransacked my bedroom and stole
  my laptop and other electronic gadgets. This resulted in me calling
  the police and having him arrested. My brother was filed with two
  cases, robbery and drugs. He is now in Jail with my father.In late 2015, I went back to Sydney for
  my 21st birthday so that I could be able to inherit the rest of my
  gift. However, when I received the news from my Uncle that I had spent
  almost all my inheritance in the last 2 years, I was deeply upset. I
  started to regret giving so much to people who only hurt me, took
  advantage of me and used me for my money. Never once did they
  appreciate the things I did for them.When I came back to the Philippines, I
  tried to collect my furniture from my grandmas house, only for her and
  my Aunty to tell me that I cannot have my things back. They did not
  want to give the furniture that I had paid for with my own money back
  to me. They stated that it now belonged to them and that I could
  afford to buy more. What they didn't realise was, they were stealing.I had plans to move back to Sydney early
  this year, when I still had a bit of money left to afford to. I wanted
  to study at TAFE and study Community Services work, however all plans
  backfired and my visa was rejected, and I found out that I was pregnant.I don't know how exactly, but all the
  money that my Nana had left me for my future, is literally gone. All
  went down the drain. And when people ask me how? I never know the
  answer. All I know is, I gave and spent money supporting people who
  are supposed to be my family, but who ended up abusing my generosity
  and kindness.I'm now 30 weeks pregnant, with an 18
  year old sister, who is also 29 weeks pregnant. I have a partner who
  works part time, seeking a full time job so that we can try and earn
  and save money. The only problem is, we are currently living with his
  parents and his step mother is not the nicest woman, and she has taken
  his work pay, saying that until we move out, the money will go to her.My sister has a partner, who sadly is
  also in Jail, and I feel worried because, even though I cannot afford
  to support my sister anymore like I could in the past, I worry because
  she doesn't have anyone who can help her, except for me.Our Mum is unemployed, and has an
  addiction to Alcohol. Our whole family over here are unemployed, and
  are either addicted to drugs, alcohol or gambling. I feel embarrassed
  in a way to be telling my story and the story of my family on my
  fundraiser, but it is the easiest way I can to try and share the
  situation we are currently in.I don't want people to pity us, or feel
  sorry for us in any way, I just want to help people understand our
  situation and my story. To give people an idea of who they are helping out.WHAT IS MY CAUSE?I know that my fundraiser is not as
  important as most others, but I'm hoping that some people out there
  are willing to help us out with anything, even if it's just a small
  and simple donation.I am currently struggling to get back on
  my feet financially, and also need money to be able to pay for
  birthing expenses for both my sister and I. My due date is September
  09 & my sister is due on September 15.I'm also trying to raise money, not only
  for the medical expenses, but also to have a bit of spare money for
  when my baby is born. I'm having a baby boy, who I've decided to name
  James, and I really want to give him the best start in life. I know
  that I'm still young, but due to me being pregnant, I was denied jobs
  when I tried to apply early this year. I had a lot of plans for myself
  this year, but all plans backfired on me when I found out that I was pregnant.I know that most people focus on the long
  term solution and goals. When reading or looking at a fundraiser, they
  usually think about two things;A) how is this going to help long term?B) how will my donation help in any way?I understand that, my fundraiser focuses
  more on short term. But it also has aspects of long term as well. Long
  term how you may ask?You'll be helping me pay medical bills,
  to ensure that I have a safe and steady operation for a Cesarean. With
  the money you donate, you'll also ensure that both my baby and I will
  live and recover. The money you also donate, will go to baby
  necessities and needs, that will be used for a long time, and will
  also help my son long term by helping him grow healthily and happily.
  The money that you donate will also help us to by basic furniture, so
  that we can move out and find our own apartment or house to rent.
  You'll be helping long term in small but very helpful ways.I know that a lot of people want to think
  of longer term solutions, but the main goal for my fundraiser is to
  try and raise as much money as I can to support not only my medical
  bills, but my sisters too, and to make sure we both have a safe
  delivery. And also buy baby needs and necessities, and have money for
  basic furniture.WHAT WILL THE MONEY BE USED FOR?Baby clothesBaby furniture (crib, pram etc)diapers & milk formula (if I'm
    unable to breastfeed)Hospital bills (for my cesarean
    operation) & my sisters normal birth deliverybasic furniture - bed frame, sofa,
    dining table & chairs, fridge, tv, gas stove & gas tank etcextra money we have will be saved for
    important things such as food & mineral waterapartment deposit (bond)ANY HELP IS APPRECIATEDWe honestly appreciate any amount of
  money that is kindly donated into our fundraiser.$5.00 - Will help us buy food for the day$10.00 - Will help us buy food for a week$15.00 - Will help us buy food for 2
    weeks plus baby essentials and needs such as diapers and milk etc$20.00 - Will help us buy a little bit
    of grocery, and a few kilos of rice, baby essentials and also save
    us money too$30.00 - Will help us pay for both my
    sister's and I's doctor check ups, which cost us around 500 PHP - it
    will also help us buy our pregnancy vitamins and milk that we need
    to take.Anything is honestly deeply appreciated. Any amount will help
    us and benefit us in any way. $1.00 = 35 PHPWhich is honestly
    a lot for us. So Imagine when we multiply the money you donate, it
    will help us with a lot of things.I just want to say thank you in advance to the generous and
    kind people who read our story and decide to help us out. We really
    do appreciate everything, if it weren't for a lot of you, we
    wouldn't have been able to go to our monthly check ups or buy our
    pregnancy vitamins and milk that we need and we wouldn't have been
    able to also afford to buy other things that we also need for our babies.EASIER WAYS TO DONATE TO MY CAMPAIGNBecause there is a fee which I pay for
  and you also pay for whenever someone donates through fundrazr, here
  are two other ways in which you can donate to my campaign.A) Transfer straight into my paypal through my paypal.me link:Paypal.me link hereB) Directly into my bank account - just email me on
    ""mariellecarlos@live.com"" or if you have me on facebook
    ask me for my BSB & ACC number, and I will send it to you.C) You can just direct transfer on this website, but I will
    not recieve the full amount of your donation, as fundrazr will
    charge me a fee.However because paypal only allows me to have a limit of 1,000
    dollars in my account, It may be best for people to transfer the
    money directly into my bank account if it's more than $100.For smaller donations feel free to just send through to my
    PayPal via my paypal.me link above :-)I really do prefer bank to bank transactions are there's no
    fee and it's easier for the both of us! :)Thank you so much for your kind donations!",Marielle Carlos,https://fundrazr.com/Help-support-young-mother,6%,$8k,$,470,3,Years running,12,"Mabalacat, Central Luzon, PH",6,13,9,0

"Children's Home of Gonaives, Haiti -Rent is Due!","Let's just say there was no business plan to create an orphanage.After a devastating hurricane blew through Haiti, leaving children in
  Gonaives, Haiti, with no parents and no home, Djemson Jeudy and his
  mother took in children orphaned by floods in Gonaives. Another
  terrible hurricane - the family took in a few more. Then in January of
  2010, as you know, there was a catastrophic earthquake that killed
  over 200,000 Haitians. Many, many children were left homeless. So this
  accidental orphanage in Gonaives became home to fifteen children,

Battle buddy for our little warrior!,"My name is David, and today (July 3rd) is my birthday! But I have a
  very special, and unique birthday wish! And that is for my little 2
  year old nephew, Enoch Peter, to be able to have many, many more birthdays!!!When he was a little younger, Enoch Peter was diagnosed with a rare
  disease, Lymphangiomatosis (also know as Gorham's disease). This
  disease causes tumors to grow throughout his little body, including in
  his bones and organs, which can cause major complications, and in some
  cases even death! Every day he battles with pain, sometimes so intense
  he can't even move!Right now awarenes of the disease is small, and since cases of this
  disease are rare (fewer than 500 cases reported world wide!!!) there
  isn't much in the way of research or treatment for the disease. That
  being said, it has been found that having a service animal to help the
  patient not only cope with the pain and receive much needed comfort,
  but also get around better on days where the pain is most intense, has
  been most benefitial!The only problem is, a well trained service animal is very expensive!
  So that is why I'm here, I want my little buddy to live a long and
  fruitful life! Full of all the wonderful and fun experiences a little
  boy should have! So please, if you would, help me do everything in my
  power to do that! Help me spread awareness of this disease so that we
  can find treatments and cures! And help me get my little warrior a
  battle buddy to help him fight the good fight!",David Dunn,https://fundrazr.com/c193Q2,73%,$1k,$,730,3,Years running,19,"Logan, US",7,3,21,6
Girls Redefined: 2016 Uganda Girls Retreat,"Children living in the slums of Kampala come from very poor
    families. Some of these children come from child-lead families.
    Parents take little interest at all in their growth and many of
    these children raise themselves.Major decisions about our roles in life or preparatory
    activities for adulthood are undertaken during adolescence but these
    children often miss out on the opportunity to be prepared for
    adulthood. Important information that can help them go through this
    stage gracefully is often not available.Girls from slums like Kosovo frequently experience sex or sexual
    abuse early in life (below the age of 13). Due to living conditions
    it is not uncommon to find a 14 year old using sex as a means of
    survival. This has affected how girls living in slums see themselves
    and how they choose to interpret the world around them.Against this background of theseGIRL-CHILDissues, Word Of Life
    Community church has organized GIRLS REDEFINED, a three day camp for
    girls ages of 13 to 17. The camp will run August 12 thru 14 and will
    provide a safe space for girls to discuss issues affecting their
    lives and identify opportunities for personal, spiritual and social
    development. This camp aims to empower the girls to redefine their
    status in society and take charge of their destiny.The Girls Redefined camp has been designed to provide the girls
    fun, learning, healing and empowering experiences. Speakers are from
    diverse backgrounds and some are survivors of child abuse. Practical
    experience will equip girls with skills helping enable them to
    overcome issues and lead meaningful lives.Will You Join Our Team and Help a Young Girl?Funds for the girls accommodations and transport have been
    found. Many of the facilitators and presenters have volunteered
    their service. What remains unfunded are meals for up to 60 girls
    over 3 days.With a gift of $25 US dollars, you can sponsor a girl’s meals
    throughout the camp and be part of this life changing process. You
    may also wish to share this need with your friends and family so

2014 Cottonwood Fourth of July Firework Show,"Hello, and thank you for visiting.  Many of you know me, but for
  the ones who do not, I am Josh London.  I, along with Victor Hundt,
  put on the annual Cottonwood fourth of July firework show.  Over the
  years past, the show has grown into a neighborhood tradition, and I
  believe that most everyone seems to enjoy it. I have personally put in
  houndred of hours Choreographing and preparing each show and
  contributed financially quite a bit to supplement what Cottonwood
  provided, but this year that is not an option for me.  I have had a
  rough year with medical issues and expenses, and have basically been
  unable to work the entire year thus far; therefore, I am unable to
  donate my usual contribution (I also got married, so the wife says
  no...).  Luckily I am mostly recovered and starting to work on this
  year's show, but we are in need of donations to cover expenses for
  supplies and equipment maintenance.  I am always willing to donate my
  time and effort into providing a great show. I know and it would mean
  a lot to me and the neighborhood if everyone could chip in a little to
  help make this happen.On average these shows run around $4000 - $5000, and that is
  simply the cost of supplies and the fireworks themselves.  I also have
  very expensive computer firing equipment in the field that usually
  takes some damage, and I would like to keep everything in good working
  order to ensure we can keep the shows running every year.If you all enjoy the show and would like to keep it going, I ask
  of you to please donate. There is no amount too small; even just a few
  dollars would help immensely.  Thank you all so much and if anyone has
  any concerns or questions, please feel free to give me a call at
  615-351-2536.  Also, if anyone is interested in learning how a
  professional firework show is set up and would like to help out,
  please let me know.  I am always in need of volunteers for the event.Thank you all!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you to all that cleaned up the firework mess this morning, but
  I really need to know where the trash was placed. I had left some of
  my equipment in the field last night with an assurance that it would
  not be trashed and it was. I am missing around $500 in equipment that
  I need to recover. In particular lots of high grade 10 AWG copper
  speaker cable. Please if anyone has this information give me a call at
  615-351-2536.Also, I am keeping the donation site up for a while longer. Due
  to some issues with the show last night I had about $2500 in equipment
  destroyed, so all in all, with the stuff missing this morning I am now
  in the hole over $3000. I am not in a position to replace this
  equipment and I purchased this years back strictly for the
  neighborhoods use with my own funds. All donations will be much
  appreciated and thank you so much to everyone who has donated so far.
  With the current state of my equipment, I will not be able to do the
  cottonwood fireworks for next year unless we can raise enough money to
  replace critical system equipment.I thought the show went great and I hope everyone had a great
  time. Thank you all for your support and I hope to be able to continue
  doing the fireworks in the future.",Josh London,https://fundrazr.com/8lzb6,66%,$3k,$,"1,980",5,Years running,51,"Franklin, TN, US",5,20,10,1

  taken to Qandil, a rebel-held war zone. Saren has been charged with
  four counts of kidnapping and there is an Interpol Red Notice calling
  for his immediate arrest and return to Canada. There is an Interpol
  Yellow Notice calling for the children's immediate return to Canada.In the seven months since the children were abducted, I have been
  working diligently with Canadian and international government and
  policing officials. I have also mounted an extensive individual search
  for my children including spending three months in Iraqi Kurdistan.
  This led to a trip to the Qandil to ask the leadership there for my
  children. They refused to even let me see them.I returned to Canada without my children, a heart break, but am

  the holiday season in Berlin, Md. Every Saturday and Sunday he would
  watch my dad get ready to ""be Santa's helper"" and at some
  point started calling him Hoho. When my dad put the Santa suit on he
  was the real deal, the twinkle in his eye, the joy he got from
  listening to little kids tell him their Christmas wishes, hopes and
  dreams. He loved it, and even after a head on collision on rt 50 in
  2010, his goal was to be better in time to be Santa.Growing up my mom worked helping mentally disabled adults, in group
  home settings, and later managing the group homes. My dad worked at a
  senior citizen day center called the friendship network, and go
  getters, who helped mentally disabled adults. When we were little my
  siblings and I never went without. We got everything we needed, and
  almost everything we wanted (you can't have a pony within town
    limits.)My parents have been on disability for deteriorating health problems
  for several years now. They still live in my childhood home, and still
  help people when they can. They have helped me many times since I've
  moved out of state, even if it's just a phone call to say how much
  they love me.The past few months they have been trying to get their car on the
  road. They just paid $650 to have it inspected, tires, fix other
  things that were wrong and tags for the car.Today the car wouldn't start, they had it towed to the shop who told
  them they were looking at least another $650 to repair the car again.They already deferred their house payment for the month, so they
  could pay the first $650. They have hardly any money to last the rest
  of the month after already paying their other bills.I'm asking for help to pay the cost of the tow, and the cost of the
  repairs including a cushion should anything else arise while it's
  being repaired. Every bit counts, I just know this would mean so much
  to them if they were to have a working vehicle, not having to arrange
  rides to get the bare essentials and go to dr visits. Thank you.",Marty Lipinski,https://fundrazr.com/1195E4,15%,$800,$,120,0,days left,4,"Hebron, MD, US",7,5,20,1

        originally intended to be short lived, but the person I came
        here with left me stranded. I've been here a year and a half now
        and I've tried to make the best of it, but its been a struggle.
        I want nothing more than to return home to be with friends and
        family when I welcome my little one into the world!During the last few months, my life has turned upside down:~My friend and I have been tormented by a stalker who has
        been trespassing and harassing us. It's been an emotional roller
        coaster of paranoia, fear, confusion, restlessness and anger.
        Thankfully, he was arrested again, but I would like to leave
        before he is released!~The Tx medical system is a joke. I've been given much
        misinformation and horrible guidance. I have been unable to
        acquire Medicaid and I can't find a reputable and affordable
        medical professional who will agree to see me. So far, the only
        one who will see me charges over a grand, for just one visit to
        do “state required lab tests”, some of which I do not agree are
        necessary, but I'm told are mandatory in Texas. According to my
        research, I qualify for medicaid in Ohio, and the medical system
        better suits my needs.~I had to quit my job. Being pregnant and working in a bar
        was just not right for me. Being self employed and looking for
        another source of income w/o a vehicle has also been a headache
        (or in Texas, a sunburn).~Various local and personal events: floods, heat, gas leak,
        parvo puppy, bed bugs, appetite loss, anxiety, zika virus scare,
        border-lining homelessness, and the list goes on...It has been difficult for me to talk about all of this and
        It's getting harder to find peace here. I've been closed off,
        emotionally unbalanced and quite honestly, embarrassed and
        somewhat depressed about my situation. I thought that I could
        figure everything out on my own, but I've been given a loving
        reminder that I need to open up and let people in again, to
        begin to move forward.It feels like I'm completely starting my life over, and It's
        been the biggest challenge I've ever faced. I have to accept the
        fact that I can't do this alone. I need a guiding a light, and a
        jump start to re-establish myself. I have to do what is best for
        the baby and I'm ready for the next chapter of my life. A
        chapter of healing, growing, learning and sharing, a chapter of
        love, light and abundance.I need your help to be able to return home and get
        everything in place to welcome this little bundle of love into
        the world. I plan to get a mini van and drive home. This will be
        such a blessing, and a long term investment that will continue
        to aid us in the future. I also need to find a job, a medical
        practitioner who suits my birth plan needs and find a place to
        live. Having my own transportation will make these tasks more
        easily obtainable.I appreciate you for taking the time to read about my
        current situation and help me to regain my footing. Thank you to
        all who have given me advice, guidance and hope throughout my
        journey. I will keep everyone updated and informed as to actions
        taken regarding this fund raiser and my over all situation and
        outcome. Much love to everyone, may you be blessed for your
        generosities, I hope it comes back to you many times over!With Gratitude,Kristiep.s.I have much to accomplish in a
  short amount of time! I need to start my voyage cross this big,
  beautiful country ASAP to continue my search for the right medical
  practitioner, a job and a place to call home.I only have a few weeks! The baby is due on July 29 th !My first milestone is to obtain a mini van. This would be a
        huge improvement in my life and ease many of my concerns! I have
        a friend who is knowledgeable, will inspect it with me, and if
        needed, help me get discounted or even free repairs before I
        leave. I have also been given a generous offer to have any over
        night stays along the way coverd so I won't have to sleep in the van!I would feel much safer driving, opposed to taking public
        transportation alone while pregnant. To have the ability to take
        breaks when I need to or in case of emergency, is important to
        me. I want to make this trip as low-stress as possible.I might even have a driving buddy to ride with me in the
        event that I can not drive/ emergency.Here is the (low-end) breakdown of my estimate:Minivan: $2,000+Medical and baby needs: $1,500+Shelter/ gas/ emergency/ other costs (including site fees
        and Paypal fees): $800 – $1,000~~(~Please consider one of my handmade donation incentive options!~)~~All items are one-of-a-kind and made with love! Avalible
        only on a first come, first serve basis, ACT FAST!!All options include a handwritten letter from me and photos

"Mother's Day Weekend, 2016 - Spoiling Supermoms!","On every holiday, EVERY single one, many families are at the hospital
  with their child.  They are unable to celebrate at home, and to be
  with their families and enjoy that special time away from trauma,
  surgery, or illness.  Because I have a child with special medical and
  physical needs, I know first-hand how hard this can be.  Lily, my
  daughter, has spent nearly every holiday at the hospital. We have
  spent two Mother's Day's, two of her birthdays, two Christmases and
  more at the hospital.  (Not to mention, many days inbetween).  There
  are families who endure years in the hospital, or months, and weeks. 
  Though staff at the hospitals can be absolutely wonderful, it does not
  replace home.This Mother's Day project is a way to pay forward the love and
  support that Lily and our family have received. To give Moms a day of
  hope, and love and a chance to be spoiled!Please help us Spoil some Supermom's on Mother's Day Weekend 2016
  (only 6 months away!) at Children's Hospital Colorado.  Last year,
  (our first year) we gave more than 100 beautiful bags packed with
  books, nail polish, handmade blankets, coffee cozies, gift cards,
  jewelry, gift certificates for facials and photography, and much
  more!  The Mothers were surprised and SO appreciative!  AND the
  support was unbelievable from people all over the U.S., including many
  local businesses and non-profits.  People came together to reach out
  to 100 Mom's - to bring them hope, and it was a beautiful experience!This coming Mother's Day, we are starting off a little different.  We
  are fundraising for the My 31 bags and microwaveable plates (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088CYQOS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=A3P6ZH9SPGPR2M)
  first! They are the most needed and enjoyed for the Mom's. The My31
  bags will be purchased from a Mom who has two children with a
  metabolic condition - I know her well, our kiddos have the same
  diagnosis :) We also need 150 lap-size blankets to be given to these
  Moms - they can be purchased or hand-made! So please start purchasing
  those and/or making them soon!  We will host blanket parties for this
  as well and will keep you updated.If you could spread the word about this fundraiser, I would really
  appreciate your help! To learn more visithttp://www.childrenscolorado.org/about/news/2015/mother-s-day-surpriseThank you!!",Sarah Portillo,https://fundrazr.com/513Gp9,117%,$3.6k,$,"4,270",0,days left,44,"Denver, US",10,9,6,4
Help us make our house a home!!!,"Hello everyone!Most of you know me, Dabney, and my wonderful kiddos, Toby and Aislin
  (and of course Scout, our ever faithful and loving pooch). Most of you
  know that it has been nearly 5 years since we set out on our own, and
  have been struggling to get our feet under us enough to afford a
  place. We have mostly stayed with my parents and once or twice with friends.Well, the day has finally come. I signed a lease on a place that will
  give us all plenty of room, a big awesome yard, and cool neighbors
  with kids Toby and Aislins age. I can't even begin to tell you what it
  means to me. What it will mean for them. It feels like life is sarting
  over for us in some ways and we can finally start putting some of
  these troubles behind us.Here's where you come in: Because of so much moving around and
  downsizing over the years, we don't have much of anything in the way
  of furniture. No beds, no couch, no chairs or tables, no washer or
  dryer, etc... I am 100% down for thrift store finds. They bring me
  great joy. It all still adds up though, and there are a few things
  that would be ideal to have new, which I plan to buy at Costco
  because, savings!! A couch for instance. I can't imagine our brand new
  place, our FIRST place together, without a big, comfy, couch to
  snuggle up on and watch movies at night... The other new items we need
  are beds. I have one for Aislin, but not myself. Toby has an antique
  bedframe in storage that he is thrilled to finally be able to use
  again, but no mattress and no box spring... Everything else I am happy
  to buy used. A table and chairs, washer and dryer, dressers, dishes, etc...This is a whole new life for us. I can't even wrap my brain yet
  around it all, I am just so overwhelmed with relief and joy that I can
  finally provide these 2 amazing kids I am blessed with rooms of their
  own, lots of space to run around in, trees to climb, comfort and
  security, not to mention getting to enjoy all of that myself after all
  these years.We need your help though. Moving expenses, utilities, deposits, rent,
  etc have got me tapped. If you have just a little bit to spare to go
  towards our fund, it will help make our new house a home in no time at
  all, and we can finally start to head onward and upward with security
  and confidence.If you don't have any money to spare, please consider sharing and
  boosting our fundraiser, or perhaps donating a gently used item that
  you no longer need that might help us meet our goal.We are grateful and simple. We don't need much, and we deeply
  appreciate any help or encouragement you can share. Thank you in
  advance from the bottom of our hearts!!! <3 <3 <3",Dabney Rigby,https://fundrazr.com/119CB1,20%,$3k,$,600,3,Years running,6,"Bastrop, TX, US",7,12,19,1
Helping the Baker family,"This fundraiser was created by friends of the Baker Family to
    help them as they begin to navigate the loss of their wife and
    mother.  We feel helpless to ease their pain, but we would like
    to help provide for the future educational needs of the Baker
    children.Please make a donation today to show the Baker Family they are
    surrounded with love and support, and that we are standing with
    them.100% of the money raised will be placed into an
      educational fund for the Baker children.In addition to this online fundraiser, we are hosting a dinner
    at the Trading Post in Fort Langley, BC on July 13th for those in
    our local community who wish to support the family .Click here for details and ticket information.This beautiful article about Nicola was published in the Peace
    Arch News:Nicola Baker was ""born to be a teacher.""The South Surrey-raised mother of four also loved Slurpees, owned her
  mistakes and delighted in seeing her students grasp the math concepts
  she endeavoured to share.""She was a brilliant teacher, a brilliant person; a leader in
  her family and a leader at the school,"" said Judy Henriques,
  Baker's aunt and a former teacher herself. ""My kids grew up with
  her and she taught them how to read and write.""The 38-year-old died unexpectedly on June 6.""In a nutshell, Nicola passed in her sleep,"" Henriques
  said. ""At this point, we don't know exactly why.""Staff and students at Earl Marriott Secondary were shocked by the
  news Monday morning.Baker had taught Grade 8 to 12 students in her time at the high
  school, but had mostly Grade 10s this past year, Henriques said.One Grade 12 student described Baker as ""one of the few people I
  knew that genuinely cared about doing right by those who depended on her.""""She was great at her job, and a lot of that came from her
  ability to understand students,"" said Ethan Peverley. ""She
  saw that some were fortunate enough to immediately take in every bit
  of a lesson thrown at them, while others needed more time to fully
  soak everything in.""Peverley added that Baker ""also dealt with troublemakers in the
  funniest way I've seen, as she'd say just the right things to make
  them question ever acting out.""Baker was the youngest of three sisters, and part of an
  ""enormous"" family that included at least two other teachers
  aside from Henriques. Baker's sister, Lori-Ann Weiss, is a science
  teacher at EMS.Henriques, a South Surrey resident who is now acting director of
  instruction for the Surrey School District, described her niece as
  ""a sweet soul"" who took care of others, humble and pragmatic.""While she was thoughtful, she could get the job done,"" she said.Baker was also a ""great storyteller,"" Henriques said.""She would tell a story in a way that, you would've been there.""Baker is survived by her husband Sean, their four young children, her
  parents Mary and Philip Du Quesnay, sisters Lori-Ann Weiss and Rene

  surgery she can be back to herself.  Our dog is a best friend to our 8
  year old and 2 year old kids and she is an important part of our
  family.  She is a bernese newfie and loves the water and rounding up
  the kids and keeping them safe at all times.  This incident has left
  us with a desire to bring our dog back to full health, but the cost of
  the surgery is high.  The overall vet bill will be over $4000 when
  taking into consideration the physical, medication, x-rays, surgery,
  and post-op follow ups.Our family is hoping to find the generosity from donors to help us
  get our dog back to health.  We would normally have the funding to
  take care of our dog, but the recent hit in the Alberta economy has

HELP MICHELE KILESHEK & HER CHILDREN !-NHS 1992,"This was written by Michelle's dear friend, Beth Monroe:On March 6, 2013 on Hwy 41 by the College Avenue exit, Michele Kilishek was involved in a car accident when a semi tractor trailer hit her rear bumper of her car, causing it to roll several times, ejecting Michele. She is at Theda Clark Medical Hospital with life-threatening injuries. At this point surgery has been performed but she is still in a chemically induced state until her vitals are at a comfortable level to slowly bring her awake. Michele is a single Mom of two great children. Davina 14 is a 4.0 student who plays the French horn and is working toward getting a saxophone. Jimmy 11 is all boy. He can build anything out of Lego’s and loved going to the movies with his Mom and Sister. An event to raise funds for Michele Kilishek is scheduled for April 6, 2013 to be held at Waverly Beach ballroom. Michele was attending Fox Valley Tech in the Welding program. She had found a new passion and was enjoying this time of her life. The goal of this event is to increase awareness of the financial need of future medical bills, to highlight family values and how important everyday life truly is. This benefit is meant to bring back some happiness to these children with some fun items to help them cope in their time of need.Heather Kiesow Rangle, and myself, Beth Monroe have been friends with Michele since the 7th grade. Now 25 years later, we have come together to show what friendship really means. I have purchased a ticket to fly in from Colorado to help with this event and spend as much time with Michele as possible. Heather lives in Appleton and has been on the phone for countless hours getting this event scheduled.We are looking for Silent Auction Donation items, and the ability to make a gift basket for each of her children. Also some activities like board games that Michele can enjoy with her kids during her long recovery.Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about this family, and our efforts to help in a their time of need.",Heidi Reagan,https://fundrazr.com/cSiZ2,17%,$5k,$,850,6,Years running,14,,3,14,22,3

Please help Daniel move - choose 7 amazing perks!,"Hello, friend!I’m coming to you today asking you to help me get away from a
    bad situation. It started 32 years ago when I was eight years old
    and dealing with an uncle who was a little too ‘fond’ of me.Over the last 22 years, I’ve learned to deal with the trauma,
    and during those years, I’ve been blessed with being to take care of
    my grandmother. She has dementia, and when she needed a nurse nearby
    at all times, our family moved her into the best nursing home we
    could find.But that’s left me beholden to the man I thought I’d put behind me.My name's Daniel. And as terrible as this story sounds, it gets
  better. And with your help, I can put it behind me.Growing up, I had a challenging childhood. When I was 13, I managed
  to escape the worst of it, and I moved in with my amazing grandmother.
  Over the next seven years, she helped me get through high school and university.From cared for to carerWhen my sister called in 2010 to tell me that Grandma had skin cancer
  and needed someone to take her to her appointments I was happy to
  help. I anticipated that it would take a few months to get through the
  appointments, and then a few months to recover.I was wrong. Grandma has a form of dementia known as a mild cognitive
  impairment. She didn't need someone for a few months; she needed a
  live-in carer.Again, I was happy to provide her with that care. She's in a nursing
  home now, but only because she needs more specialised care than I can
  give her at home.Becoming a tenant in Grandma's houseTo pay for her nursing home fees, we took in tenants. That
  arrangement worked well up until last year.My uncle has legal responsibility for Grandma's financial affairs. In
  other words, he's my landlord. As a child, my uncle was a little too
  fond of me. So much so that last year I pursued criminal charges
  against him.In the meantime, he's evicted me from Grandma's house, and I was
  supposed to be out by 10 June 2016. However, I haven't succeeded in
  finding anywhere to move. So now I have until at least next Wednesday,
  15 June 2016.Where the money goesI'd love to raise a total of $3,820 for the following expenses
  involved in moving to a new home:bond and first month's rent ($1,300)removalist costs ($1,800)cleaning and gardening costs ($720).My income is the Disability Support Pension (I have bipolar disorder,
  brought on in part by my uncle's abuse) and I'm working to establish
  myself as a freelance copywriter.My goal is to find and move into an inspiring home that frees my
  creativity. To build up my copywriting business so I can live off
  income I earn rather than a handout from the government.Shortly, I'd also love to run workshops teaching people how to
  survive tough times.In short, I want to leave the negativity of my uncle in the past and
  move toward a positive future of my design.You can help make this possible. With what you give, you can change
  my future.Please give what you can, or share my story so that others can give.",Daniel Taylor,https://fundrazr.com/918WJd,18%,$3.8k,$,690,0,days left,13,"Pascoe Vale, VIC, AU",6,2,20,3

Please help us get Carlos home to his family.,"My name is Michelle and Im gonna tell you Carlos story. On December
  26 2014 was the night that changed all our lives forever. Carlos was
  passenger in his friends car, the driver was speeding, lost control
  and caused a one car roll ever accident. Carlos was stuck inside the
  car as it rolled over. He was pinned in the back seat once paramedics
  arrived. It took them 20 minutes to get him out of the car. He was
  airlifted to the nearest hospital and admitted into the ICU Trauma
  Unit. He was hooked up to a ventilator and put in a medically induced
  coma. All his family resides in Florida. He was living in Ohio with
  myself (his girlfriend) and 10 year old daughter. His family drove the
  16 hours and got here the next night. Every one of our lives were
  changed from that moment. The night that I saw him laying in that bed
  having a machine breathe for him is an image that I see everyday. He
  remained in the ICU unit for about 2 weeks. We prayed that everyday
  would be the day he would wake up. Once he was released from the
  Trauma unit, they sent him to an acute nursing facility. Besides the
  brain trauma he also suffers from many fractures to his face,
  fractures in his neck , and ribs. He had some issues and had to insert
  a chest tube. He had his mouth wired shut and a metal plate in his chin.We celebrated News Years with him in his room. His dauhgters only
  birthday wish was for her daddy to wake up. So on January 8th we went
  and had a small cake for her in his room. Sadly her birthday wish
  didnt come true. That didnt stop us. We kept the faith and still
  continue to hope that the next day will be that day he came back to
  us. He had different issues that had him go back to the hospital 3
  different times. Family has been in from Florida to show their love
  and support. We started to notice little things that he was doing, but
  the Doctors would always excuse it as a reflex. Any hope that we had
  would be crushed. We knew inside that these couldnt just be a reflex.
  We all knew Carlos was a fighter! We went from periods on him sleeping
  the whole visit and not showing us anything, to his eyes open and we
  could feel the connection. He started to even blow kisses. I would ask
  for him to blow a kiss and he would. How do the doctors still call
  that a reflex?!? The last time he was admitted back into the hospital
  they did another CT scan and MRI and an EEG. The results of these test
  would change us all forever.Once the Neuro came in on February 13 2015 and told us that Carlos
  has significant brain damage and the EEG showed low brain activity. He
  told us that Carlos was in a persistant vegitative state and him
  coming out of this was very unlikely. Carlos wouldnt be able to
  Comminucate with us again. He got released and went back to the
  nursing facility. We never gave up on him. We knew what he was showing
  us and that within time we can get him back. Once we heard the results
  his family felt that best way for his recovery will be to have him
  home with his family there by his side full time and not traveling
  back and forth every couple weeks. Only problem medicaid wont cover
  transportation. Thats why we started this fund. We went to all
  measures of asking and borrowing but unable to come up with full
  amount. Since the results from the neuro Carlos has been showing us
  some signs again. He went from sleeping and no eye opening for about 2
  weeks to his eyes open most of the time and he is even shaking his
  head yes or no when we ask some questions. These commands are not
  follwed at all times but everyday he does show us his response. If his
  eyes are closed we will ask him to open and he does. I ask him to blow
  me a kiss and some times he does and others he wont. Please help us
  get Carlos back to his family in Florida. Thank you and God Bless you all!",millie roldan,https://fundrazr.com/bx2Hc,4%,$7k,$,300,4,Years running,4,"Youngstown, US",2,28,20,5

  tree got into a fight and the tree won.  Thankfully my sister and I
  came out of the accident without a scratch. However the past few
  months have been a large struggle for me.  The city denied my claim
  and i wasn't able to get any money for the car even though i had put
  so much into it.  I am constantly paying 15 dollars a ride to get
  anywhere because i live outside the city now and it adds up so much
  that i haven't been able to put a dent in my""new car fund"".I am asking for a little help to regain my sanity... I need to
  raise money for a down payment on a car.  With the travel costs of
  getting around to my jobs i spend anywhere between $300-560 a month on
  transportation.  Having a car would allow me to get home safely from
  work at night (i get off at midnight) and allow me to get the right
  amount of sleep by giving me extra time in the mornings before work. 
  Working the amount of hours i do and having such long days has taken
  it's toll on many aspects on my life and i know this is what i need to
  do to make some positive changes.Asking for this is not an easy thing to do however I am running

Nepal earthquakes! Help an orphanage and a village,"PORTUGUÊSNo dia 25 de abril e no dia 12 de maio de 2015, o
  Nepal sofreu grandes terramotos que deixaram milhares de habitantes
  sem condições mínimas de sobrevivência. Diante desse desastre, um
  grupo de quatro amigos se uniu para tentar amenizar a situação do país
  através de um projeto solidário.Em novembro de 2014, eles se conheceram através de um propósito
  em comum, conhecer a cultura e religião Nepalesa. Envolvidos em causas
  sociais, desenvolveram dentro de suas profissões trabalhos em
  orfanatos e demais lugares afetados pela situação precária do país.Após a tragédia, duas pessoas que marcaram emocionalmente cada
  um desse grupo de amigos, entraram em contato com um pedido de
  socorro. Asha Yuten Tamang, 17 anos, vivia no orfanato junto das
  outras 24 crianças, que agora se encontram sem um local seguro para
  morar, alimentos, roupas e água. Suraj Bhandari, 29 anos, vive em um
  vilarejo de 70 habitantes, que atualmente se encontra completamente
  devastado, em situação similar a de Asha.Diante dos fatos, os quatro amigos motivados pelo vínculo criado
  durante a estadia no Nepal, resolveram unir suas habilidades e
  experiências para pedir apoio, e assim ajudar essas pessoas. Eles
  acreditam que a mobilização de cada um perante uma causa, ainda que
  com um alcance pequeno diante de uma grande população, é capaz de
  atingir um todo. É com a pequena colaboração de todos que
  conseguiremos mudar esta realidade devastadora que assola milhares de
  pessoas no Nepal.O orfanato Solu Welfare, em Jorpati, e o vilarejo Simthali
  precisam da nossa colaboração. Ajudando com apenas USD $10,00, você
  consegue alimentar uma pessoa durante um dia com duas refeições de dal
  baat, comida típica nepalesa composta por arroz, legumes e pão.
  Ajudando com USD $25,00, você ajuda a alimentar uma pessoa por dia com
  dal baat, além de água e cobertores para o inverno nepalês. A partir
  de USD $50,00, você estará alimentando uma pessoa por uma semana nesta
  catástrofe. Para valores acima de USD $100,00, além de ajudar a
  alimentar um pequeno grupo de pessoas, você também estará colaborando
  para a compra de produtos de higiene pessoal e de sobrevivência.
  Apesar de tudo, é livre de contribuir com o que pode, tendo em conta
  que para nós faz sentido que o mínimo seja USD $3,00.Ajude nesta missão! Unidos somos mais fortes! O nosso muito obrigado./ENGLISHOn April's 25th and May's 12th of 2015, Nepal
  suffered huge earthquakes which left thousands of habitants without
  the minimal conditions to survive. Facing this disaster, a group of
  four friends decided to unite and try to ease this country's situation
  through a solidarity project.On November 2014, they met through a common purpose, to know
  Nepal's culture and religion. Involved in social causes, they
  developed, under their professions, works in orphanages and other
  places affected by the precarious situation of Nepal.After this tragedy, two people that emotionally changed each one
  of this group of friends, made contact with an help pledge. Asha Yuten
  Tamang, 17 years old, lived at an orphanage along with 24 other
  children, and they're now without a safe place to live, without food,
  clothes and water. Suraj Bhandari, 29 years old, lives at a village of
  70 habitants which is currently completely devastated, similarly with
  Asha's situation.Facing these facts, the four friends, driven by their bow during
  their stay at Nepal, decided to use their skills and experiences to
  ask for support and therefore help these people. They believe that the
  mobilization from each one of you, even though within a small range
  compared to this large population, is capable of reaching a whole.
  It's with the small contribution of everyone that we can change this
  devastating reality that is plaguing thousands of people in Nepal.The Solu Welfare orphanage, in Jorpati, and the Simthali village
  need our help. Helping with USD $10,00, you can feed a person for one
  day with two dal baat meals, which is the typical nepali food
  consisted of rice, vegetables and bread. Helping with USD $25,00, you
  can help feed a person for one day with dal baat, water and blankets
  for the Nepali winter. From USD $50,00, you'll be helping feed a
  person for a week during this catastrophe. Values higher than USD
  $100,00, besides helping feeding a small group of people, you'll also
  be buying hygiene and survival supplies. However, you're free to

Nepal Direct Support - Help the earthquake victims,"Me and my family have been deeply shocked and saddened by the damage
  and devastation caused by the horrible earthquakes and the ongoing
  aftershocks in Nepal. As many of you will know, my husband is from
  Nepal and his parents and close family are living in Kathmandu.
  Luckily they are all fine but they have seen so much devastation and
  destruction first hand that we as a family have decided to help the
  most vulnerable people directly.We have identified that the quickest and most effective way to
  help is to send money to buy the most urgently needed items directly
  in Nepal and distribute them to the affected communities directly.We have already previously raised money and were able to distribute
  blankets and dried food for 150 people in Dhading, a badly affected
  village 90 km outside of Kathmandu which was very close to the
  epicentre of the first earthquake. Not much aid had reached the
  village due to its remoteness and the villagers were extremely
  grateful for our help.We would have loved to send physical aid however at the moment it is
  not advisable to send this independently due to the following issues:Kathmandu Aiport is still jammed with aid from the big
    charities that has not been delivered due to lack of manpower/
    equipment and hardly any coordination from the government. Any
    further aid sent will add to this backlog and will be delayed until
    it is cleared by customs and finally delievered so it is not a
    timely option.All independently sent charity cargo is being taxed upon arrival
    in Nepal even if it is clearly labelled as charity or relief goods.
    We have heard about a charity shipment of 100 blankets attracting a

Please help John & James Cornelius,"On Thursday, the 7th of April 2015, 2 of our Catalog manager team
  members in Penang Malaysia , received a call from their parents
  informing them that the family’s house has caught fire and is badly
  damaged. Over the weekend,John & James Corneliushave been working round
  the clock to salvage any undamaged items at their parents’ home. We’re
  glad to learn that, nobody was home at that time and the entire
  Cornelius family is safe and sound. However, a big portion of the
  house has been badly damaged in the fire.The living room & the dining room are total losses, while the
  kitchen is slightly damaged. The entire ground floor ceiling (and
  hence, the upstairs’ floor), has cracks all over it and is deemed
  unsafe for anyone to even go upstairs, let alone live there. The
  family is now living with their relatives. The house needs to be
  repaired, the wirings re-installed and the ground floor ceiling
  demolished, then rebuild.As a team, we would like to extend our support and help to the
  Cornelius brothers during this time of tragedy. As such, we’ll be
  collecting donations as an aid for the family. No amount is too big or
  too small. It’s the heart and the thought that counts. Every little
  bit helps. If you wish to contribute, please pass the donation to me

Please help us fix the Austin family's home!,"Hi, my name is Jeff Austin.  Some you may know the hardships our
  family has endured the past several years, but many of you do not.  I
  hate that it has come to this, asking others for help; after all, my
  family is a proud, independent family.  But here we are, in desperate
  need of your help.Our family has suffered some major financial hardships in the past
  4 years.  My mother, Marcia Austin, went on permenant disability about
  3 years ago.  As a result, our home equity loan payments were backed
  up and the bank began forclosure procedures.  Since that time, Marcia
  was diagnosed with kidney failure, COPD, had a stroke affecting her
  vision, and Congestive Heart Failure.  She is on dialysis, oxygen, and
  can barely walk.My sister, her 2 young sons, and I live with her and do everything we
  can to help  keep the household running.  With 5 people living in a 3
  bedroom ranch, it can be a bit tight!We are trying to raise money to help with VERY URGENT household
  repairs.  Marcia's income was slashed in half when she went on Social
  Security/Disability, and half of THAT is going to back payment on the
  mortgage (if we miss just one payment in the next 12 years, they will
  take the house).  Since my sister is also raising two boys and I have
  car and student loans, household repairs have been put on the
  backburner lately.First and foremost, we would like to raise $5000 for a new AC unit,
  since ours stopped working last May.  Last summer was very rough on my
  mother and I'm afraid she might not survive another without central
  air. Our old AC lasted 28 years and we were so thankful it has.
   Because of my mother's health problems, she has trouble breathing in
  normal temperatures, let alone in house that, last summer, got into
  the 80 degree range.  We installed a window unit in her bedroom, but
  it's not sufficient for the rest of the house, and multiple window
  units are not long term efficient.  I REALLY am afraid for this summer
  without a new AC.  The second repair is for hole over our kitchen sink
  that causes a horrible draft (and energy leak).  It's estimated to be
  about $700.It kills me to have to post on this site, but please, we are
  desperate.  We can't afford to fix these repairs, and we can't afford
  to move because of our second mortgage.  We have tried HEAP and
  similar programs but were denied.  If anyone has any other
  recommendations, I'd love to hear them also.  My mother has been a
  rock my whole life, and taught us the value of independence.  We have
  tried to save up, but one thing after another keeps knocking us down.Please help make our house habitable again for a sick woman and 2 children!",Jeffrey Austin,https://fundrazr.com/Austinhomefix,14%,$5k,$,680,3,Years running,12,"Milford, OH, US",3,31,18,3
Chess Traders™,"Igniting a Passion for Chess***What you see is a concept prototype, not a finished product.
   Should it be brought to retail market?  We need your vote of support
  if you think so.***Here’s the StoryThe idea started because I wanted to inspire my kids ages 5 through
  10 to play chess.  You see, I fell in love with chess when I was a kid
  and I’m so thankful I did.  I wanted that same thing for my kids but I
  knew it wouldn’t be easy given the myriad of distractions competing
  for their attention andlet's face it, on the surface chess
    can appear somewhat stuffy, boring and just plain uncool.It’s not something most kids are going out of their way with
  excitement to learn.  I knew there had to be a way to make the
  perception more appealing to my kids.When I thought back to why I fell in love with chess as a kid I
  realized my initial interest was in the brightly colored figures of my
  dad’s medieval themed chess set.  It was the figures of archers
  holding bows and arrows stretched all the way back into launch
  position; the knights on top of galloping war horses with flowing
  skirts ready to joust; the swordsman and bishops, queens in gowns and
  crowns, kings in suits of armor and rooks that looked like castle
  towers and each one had been individually hand painted with detailed
  colors.Those figures brought my imagination to
  life.They’re what inspired me to learn how to play.I was mesmerized by each of the pieces for their uniqueness and that
  lead me to want to understand the game, learn and interact with the
  pieces as much as possible.If these pieces had been the typical
    Staunton chess pieces made from plastic or wood you see in most
    every set, I highly doubt I would have ever had any interest.From there I grew to enjoy the game for all of its benefits, but it
  was those medieval themed character pieces that were the spark that
  ignited my lifelong passion.Those pieces also came to represent more than just a game to
    me,it became an opportunity to have one on one dedicated
    interaction with my dad.A way that he and I could relate
  and I could receive his undivided attention.  The games became more
  than games, they became cherished memories.  That chess set is the one
  thing I hope to inherit from my dad someday for its sentimental value.Playing chess was more than just a lifetime of fun and memorable
  moments with my dad, it also taught me lifelong skills such as
  strategic thinking, deep concentration and the power of leverage.
   WhichI think as parents we all desire to teach and pass
    along to our children.So I knew there had to be a way to for my kids to experience the same
  intrigue with chess that had gripped me as a child but as I looked to
  buy an existing set I just couldn’t find anything that came close to
  the idea I had in mind, so I created my own for my kids.And it's worked!My kids have become extremely
  interested in playing chess in a way that I would’ve never imagined
  possible otherwise and they are constantly asking me to play and play
  each other.We are now creating another generation of memories and cherished
  interactions together.So Why Chess?Chess is a game that has taught great leaders the skills that have
  made success in life achievable.  It’s a game of logic, skill and
  winning is often about recognizing and seizing opportunity.  Above all
  Chess is a game about planning and prediction, in other words,
  strategy.  Chess can be an extremely rewarding game and often provides
  players with the confidence in themselves to succeed in other areas.What parent wouldn't mind seeing their child set down the
    electronic device for a little whileand engage in a good
  ole’ fashioned board game with another person, right?  After all,
  inside every child, there sits an enormous amount of curiosity waiting
  to be ignited and chess is one of the tools that can do just that.The ConceptCreate a world of kid-friendly chess piece characters that can
    be interchanged to represent any piece on the board as well as
    collectable and tradeable; which in turn allows kids to
  build their own unique set of customized chess pieces.  This adds a
  facet to the game that makes it more fun and engaging, easier to learn
  and most importantly appealing to the uninitiated.The figures are detachable from the bases.  The bases represent the
  value of each piece (ie, rook, pawn, queen, etc..) and the figures are
  interchangeable with all the bases.  Kids can configure their set with
  the figures they have any way they see fit.Kids can choose
    their bases from a variety of different designs.As incentive to play to their very best ability and consistently
  improve their skill as players, we encourage a swap of at least one
  piece at the winner’s discretion based on the outcome of the game.
  This is not a hard and fast rule but we have foundhaving a
    little something on the line makes the game all that more
  exciting.Kids should agree ahead of starting the game how
  many, if any figures will be exchanged at the end.  The winner then
  chooses a figure of their choice from the opponents set and provides a
  replacement figure in replacement for the one they acquired back to
  their opponent.  Only figures are traded and bases always remain with
  their respective owner.The bases come with cards with visual examples of the moves pieces
  can make. Allowing kids toeasily learn and conceptualize the
    options as well as remind themselves during a game.  The
  figures come with stories of their background.Concept to RealityTheimages you see represent the concept prototype but are
    not the finished designfor mass production.  We envision
  using colorful and unique vynil character pieces similar to the Super
  Mario example below.  The target user audience being ages 6+ and their parents.Example of a Character Themed Vynil SetWhat's Needed?We need to know your thoughts about this?Is this a good idea?Could this have mass appeal to kids and parents alike?Could you see wanting this for your own kids?If so, we need your support and backing to turn this from a concept
  prototype into a marketable retail game.  We need your financial
  support to cover the cost of the molds, design, branding, packaging
  and distribution.  You might imagine how very expensive it is to bring
  something like this to market.Without your support we’ll be left to assume this is an idea
    without an audience or mass appeal.CostsManufacturing in a manner that balances quality with affordability is
  the key to the success of this and having community of people that
  share a passion for the game of Chess become involved will ensure the
  projects success.  To ensure success through quality and affordability
  the following costs have been estimated, doing things properly is
  essential, keeping the quality high and taking this Chess game to
  market effectively are all considerations.The estimated funding required is:Mold Creation and Production $20,000Chess Piece design $5,000Packaging $5,000Chess piece manufacture (small scale escalating to mass) $25,000Marketing  $7,500Distribution $10,000TOTAL $72,500Your PartChess has provided many people skills for success in life, our hope
  is that this idea will someday help your child or a child you know do
  the same.  More importantlywe hope this idea will create
    meaningful interactions between parents and childrenwith
  fond and lasting memories of your time together.Your investemnt inthis concept is more than just an
    investment to bring yet another entertaining toy to market,
  it is an investment into the lives of our young and budding leaders. 
  Your investment could produce the next President, great business
  leader or engaged and caring parent passing along the skills they
  learned as child because they were fortunate enough to have been
  introduced to a world of character figures that ignited a lifelong
  passion for chess.Please give your opinion.Vote.Join.Participate.Support.Let us know if you think this is worthwhile.Again, without your support we’ll be left to assume this is

Hazel Gene's 100th Birthday Celebration,"My Grandmother Hazel Gene is nothing short of an inspiration. In her
  almost 100 years of life she has been someone who truly represents
  unconditional love. She is humble, loving, kind, giving, accepting and
  thoughtful beyond measure. A few years ago she was hospitalized for a
  bad back and told she would never walk again. A few months later she
  was walking. She never ceases to be my one true source of inspiration.
  If the are angels that walk on this Earth, she is one of them. Her
  secrets to longevity are simple: Don't worry too much, stay active,
  and of course, Oil of Olay.I am her grandchild Heather, and honored to throw her a 100th year of
  life celebration. I'm also the last person in my family to ever step
  up to this task. In fact, I'm taking a 4 month leadership course just
  so I can make this happen for her in a way that is best for her. I
  know in my heart that she would love to be surrounded by family, and
  we are all spread out across the U.S. My goal is to have as many
  family members attend as possible, especially all of her children. The
  fund raiser is to pool together money for the small celebration itself
  at the church she volunteered at. It will be held over a 2 week period
  (as to not overwhelm her) and will have a family reunion/gathering
  somewhere in the middle. The fund raiser will also be to support and
  make money available to anyone who would not be able to come due to
  travel costs. Whatever is left over will be given to her to help  pay
  her living expenses.Instead of surprising Grandma, my Aunt Sharon and I chose to tell her
  what we are planning for her. It brought her to tears of joy. I am
  grateful for your consideration to support bringing Hazel her family. :)",Heather Annaliece Young,https://fundrazr.com/1i9eb,27%,$5k,$,"1,350",5,Years running,23,"San Francisco, CA, US",3,5,4,2

Good thing he's our self nominated Strategic Advisor. :)  Please submit your contribution to the reunion cost here.  Your $20 will go to cover cost of food and drinks until we run out of money. I hope you all can make it!!! -Marlo",Marlo Hartung,https://fundrazr.com/1N1Gd,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please help Ukrainian community to save Sergiy!,"This fundraiser is a joined effort of Ukrainian community in Thailand
  to help our member.Sergiy Kelshev is a 30 year old freelance photographer from Mariupol.
  On 26th March 2015, while driving his motorbike on a photo expedition
  in Vietnam, Sergiy became a victim of a terrible road accident.A truck entered into Sergiy's lane and Sergiy had no chance to avoid
  the truck and was hit dead-on, being dragged 40 meters under the front
  bumper. His right thigh bones were crashed, back muscles torn apart;
  he got 4 pelvic fractures and sustained bladder and intestines
  rupture. Doctors from 3 Vietnamese hospitals had fought for Sergiy's
  life, however due to tissue necrosis his condition got worse over
  time. Sergiy had to be transferred to Bumrungrad international
  hospital in Thailand for a series of complex surgeries.Unfortunately, Sergiy’s medical insurance expired just 1 month before
  his accident. Ukrainian expat community in Thailand joined hands with
  Sergiy’s family, his friends, fellow photographers to help Sergiy
  fully recover from his injuries. As of today, his condition is still
  life threatening due to progressing necrosis. Further surgeries and
  therapy will cost thousands of dollars.Currently Sergiy awaits being transported to Ukraine for a further
  medical care, when his condition is stable enough for a long haul flight.Any donation will help Sergiy to have a proper medical treatment and
  get back to normal life. 100% of these proceeds will go to Sergiy
  Kelshev. Please find it in your hearts to help him!Here is a link to our ""Save Sergiy"" group on Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/284900448300362/",Sasha Golokoz,https://fundrazr.com/0yl96,1%,$15k,$,200,4,Years running,2,"Bangkok, TH",4,22,12,2

  knee and severely damaged all my ligaments I also had nerve damage in

  not even walk but that didnt stop me. When I started phsyiotherapy I
  was very determind to get back onto a trampoline. My physiotherapist
  was brilliant. He pushed me to my limits as he knew how much i wanted
  to get back to competing again. When I attended the clinic I became
  aware how expensive all of the equiment was. I was very grateful to
  have access to this equipment as it has made such a big difference to
  my rehabilitation. Not only am i able to walk again but with a lot of
  care and encouragement from Physiotherpist I am now competing and in
  fact I have recently qualified for the British Schools Finals in
  Birmingham in March 2015.My physiotherapist has inspired me to consider physiotheraphy as an

Can you help bring my grandson home?,"My son needs our help to bring his baby boy home.Get ready for a love story. Over a year ago my son Jackson met the
  love of his life- a beautiful, sweet, gentle, loving soul- Hailey- an
  American visiting our shores on a holiday visa. They met, fell in love
  and have cultivated a deep level of love and respect for each other,
  and now their little love nest is about to get even better with the
  approaching arrival of their baby boy- due in April.That's right! Our grandson is due 3/4/16! We are all so very
  excited!. But, with Hailey being an American Citizen, she is not
  eligible for Medicaid or any benefits here in Australia. This leaves
  us with estimates of $12000 in medical bills to delivery the baby in
  Australia. Having the baby in Australia is NOT an option. Our cheaper
  solution is flying Jackson and Hailey to America where they can
  deliver the baby free of medical costs!My son Jackson is just 20 years old. He works over 40 hours a week
  and travels the Bruce highway to work from the Sunshine Coast daily.
  They are saving every cent they can to support their new family. They
  have sold what they don't need and have cut costs to a bare minimum.
  Through the kindness of friends and family- furniture and clothing for
  the baby have been gifted- what a great saving that has been and we
  are endlessly grateful! But they still need more help.Unfortunately, the financial struggle doesn't stop once the baby is
  born. The reality is that Hailey and the baby require Australian
  residency to be able to return to and live in our country permanently.
  The visa that Hailey currently has means she must leave Australia
  every three months and will only last until September 2016 with no
  eligibility for renewal and she is unable to legally work in our
  country to contribute to the family income. The visa she needs to
  become a resident costs $7000!!! Long term this will mean that without
  the funds for the visa, Hailey and the baby will need to return to the
  USA to live.This is terrible news for them! It would break their hearts to be
  separated like this. Not to mention the ongoing financial strain.  If
  you have ever had to apply for a residency visa you know just how
  stressful and time consuming and expensive this process is.With only a few months left before Hailey's visa runs out, she will
  need to apply for the permanent visa very soon. The residency,
  medical, airfare and relocation costs have piled up and are way out of
  their league, on a single salary.What does this mean for us financially to bring Hailey and the baby
  home to Australia and keep my son's family together?$3000 return flights to America for Jackson and Hailey$500 baby's passport/s$7000 Hailey's residency Visatotal $10,500...We are putting every spare cent we have into their savings but we
  need help!How can you assist?Can you share this campaign via your social media pages?Can you gift the smallest donation?Every share and every dollar counts toward easing the financial and
  emotion burden this is causing our family.From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of Jackson and Hailey- we
  thank you all in advance and look forward to sharing happy baby snaps
  with you very soon.xNatalie",Natalie McIvor,https://fundrazr.com/d16I31,71%,$9.5k,$,"6,790",3,Years running,40,"Sunshine Coast, QLD, AU",2,11,11,3
Help Leslyn kick cancer's butt once and for all!,"Please share my campaign.......Her Story:I am 37, mother of two beautiful girls, ages 12 and 9, and wife of 12
  years. I was first diagnosed with Stage3b Cervical Cancer in 2012 and
  have since run out of North Carolina, Insurance covered, treatment
  options, and I don’t want to die. I need help with additional
  treatment and personal expenses.Here’s the story of my fight with cancer.I was first diagnosed with Stage3b Cervical Cancer in 2012. After a
  radical hysterectomy on December 28, 2012, an outside pathological
  study had revealed that “my cancer” had spread to my lymph nodes and
  to other areas outside of my cervix.  It was then decided that the
  cancer that originally was thought to have been in early stages and
  had not spread would require further treatment of brachytherapy
  (internal radiation), external beam radiation and adjuvant
  chemotherapy treatment of a drug called Cisplatin.  After months of
  treatment and recovery, my life slowly returned to as normal as it
  could until pain began to persist in my left pelvic region and in my
  back.  After a number of phone calls and pleadings with my oncologist
  to investigate, in 2014, she finally agreed to perform a scan,
  however, it was for the purposes of supporting her idea that the back
  pain was not cancer related and she would be sending me out to some
  sort of back specialist in order to address that pain and that the
  pain I was feeling in my pelvic area was a result of forming scar
  tissue and the healing process of nerves in that area after my surgery.Once the scan was performed, I received the devastating news that my
  intuition was right, and that the pain, in fact, was due to new cancer
  mass in my left lower abdominal wall and it would need to be removed
  ASAP. She also revealed that the cancer was most likely the result of
  what she called a port site recurrence-a phenomenon believed to occur
  through the transfer of cancer cells from surgical tools or to high of
  CO2 pressures during surgery robotic surgery and the cancer cells
  would “seed” in the scar tissue where I was cut open.  There was less
  than a 1.5% risk of this occurrence, a risk that was not known to me
  and was not even included in any of my paper work warning me of what
  could happen if I agreed to this surgery.  The cancer was removed in
  November of 2014, at which time, my bowel was twisted before she
  closed the area that she opened up and caused a bowel blockage that
  hospitalized me for several weeks.In January of 2015, I began another regimen of external beam
  radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy for months and then once that was
  complete, I began what is called, systemic chemotherapy, with 2
  different chemo therapies along with the addition of a new drug that
  had been approved as an addition to the normal “standard of care” or
  treatment that was intended to slow down the future recurrence of
  disease and hopefully increase survival periods. During my systemic
  chemo treatments, I began to have pain onset and progression similar
  to the previous recurrence/mass, to which my oncologist, again, said
  was an unlikelihood for several reasons, but said she could not
  perform a scan until the completion of chemotherapy for accuracy
  purposes to know for sure.  Once I completed chemo, a PET/CT was
  performed, at which time, yet another tumor was discovered.  My
  oncologist told me there was nothing she could do for me at this point
  but remove the tumor and wait for another recurrence and continue to
  remove them as we are able for as long as we could while holding out
  for data for other cervical cancer treatments.  When she said this, I
  cried, I ran out of the office and screamed when I went outside and
  immediately fell to my knees. I was DEVESTATED!!!!! My heart sank as
  soon as I realized that I would have to tell my sweet girls that this
  chapter of our lives is not yet behind us.  I also made the choice to
  no longer use that oncologist and contacted another, who was able to
  enroll me in a clinical trial that I have been a part of for the past
  three months, which leads me to where I am today…..The clinical trial
  I was in got suspended by the CDC and FDA with no notice of
  returning.  I am out of NC treatment options; my insurance doesn’t
  cover out of state expenses.  I called MD Anderson and they want a
  $29k dollar deposit, and Cancer Centers of America are asking for
  $250k.  All other treatments are going to cost money, plus travel.  I
  have reached the limits of my insurance and all local options for
  treatment.  I don’t want to die.  I don’t want my sweet girls to grow
  up without a mom, but that is what’s going to happen if I don’t get
  help for treatments and expenses.  Please do not allow me to become
  another cancer statistic, I beg you.  Thank you to everyone who helps
  support me in my fight.  I am not famous, I know, but I don’t deserve
  to die, and I certainly do not deserve to be a casualty due to
  financial loss or absence.  Our worth is measured by more than the
  checks we can write.My family has been devastated by all of this. I don’t want my girls
  to learn to give up or that our life’s value is determined by
  insurance and pharmaceutical companies, research labs and cancer
  centers, majorities or louder minorities.  1 person suffering from a
  disease is enough to warrant budgets, research, funding and so on. 
  All options left for me are immunotherapies, which can be
  revolutionary in helping to teach our bodies to fight this disease
  itself and others; This is no coincidence.  Helping me will also help
  other women in my position if science can learn from me.  It could
  save yours or my daughters’ lives some day.  God has blessed me with
  being a healthier patient in the respect that this disease has not
  traveled to my organs. I am confident that God’s will is for me to be
  here, to help, through my “trials”, save the lives of other women,
  with my fight.",Linda Seidel,https://fundrazr.com/9RaVa,11%,$60k,$,"6,865",6,Years running,130,"Charlotte, NC, US",2,21,20,3
Los Mellos Gonzalez,"Todos conocemos la situación de los mellos González Rosado. Algunos
  conocemos las circunstancias que la provocaron y los detalles de las
  mismas, otros quizás no tanto y se preguntan qué pasó, haciendo
  cábalas y conjeturas próximas o alejadas de la realidad. Los mellos
  quizás se equivocaron de camino, quizás fueron inconscientes y no
  supieron evaluar el riesgo, quizás entregaron su suerte a la
  providencia... O quizás no fue así. Poco importa eso ahora, forma
  parte del pasado y no habrá otra oportunidad. Lo que sí es
  indiscutible y que algunos defenderemos siempre, es que los mellos son
  personas de alta calidad humana, incapaces de perjudicar al prójimo y
  con gran capacidad de amar y ser amados. En el declive de sus vidas,
  luchan por mantener su dignidad pero su capacidad y su fuerza flaquean
  a pasos agigantados, por mucho que se obstinen en disimular frente a
  los demás y frente a ellos mismos, fingiendo conservar la esperanza de
  tiempos mejores. Son la fe y la ilusión los únicos pilares de sus
  vidas, la honradez y la dignidad el sustento. Sin ánimo de alargar
  demasiado este preámbulo, solo queremos añadir que nos cuesta ser
  breves al hablar de estas dos personas entrañables porque son muchas
  las cualidades que se pueden citar a propósito de ellos. Podríamos
  decir que son dos grandes corazones nobles, inocentes, bondadosos y un
  tanto infantiles albergados en dos cuerpos de octogenarios con un
  único recurso, el de la Fe.Nuestra MotivaciónSomos muy realistas y sabemos que su subsistencia será
  desesperada en breve plazo porque hoy ya es crítica. Por eso hemos
  decidido que no podemos seguir siendo testigos pasivos de ello. Pero
  también somos conscientes de que ninguno de nosotros puede remediar el
  problema, ninguno puede asumir la responsabilidad de procurarles un
  futuro. No al menos de forma individual pero por qué no de forma colectiva?Nuestra PropuestaEstamos seguros de que todos les hemos ayudado alguna vez de
  forma puntual. Pero todos hemos concluido de que no podemos asumir sus
  necesidades con lo poco que podemos aportar, que lo que ellos
  necesitan sobrepasa los límites de nuestra capacidad. Pero no hemos
  caído en cuenta de que una pequeña aportación puede significar mucho
  cuando se trata de una iniciativa colectiva. Se trata de aportar un
  granito de arena para crear una montaña suficientemente sólida como
  para detener ese porvenir desgraciado que les espera a Ricardo y
  Orlando. Privarse de un pequeño capricho cada mes, ser un poco más
  austeros a la hora de hacer las compras, privarse de un pequeño gasto
  superfluo cotidiano, conformarse con salir al restaurante o al cine
  una vez menos cada mes, ... en suma, un ínfimo sacrificio para la
  mayoría de nosotros que puede convertirse en un futuro digno y sólido
  para ellos si somos numerosos los que nos asociamos. Todos hemos
  pensado alguna vez que nuestra modesta aportación no resuelve nada y
  que el problema persiste aunque se retrase. Pero y si unimos nuestros
  recursos? cualquier participación por mínima o ridícula que parezca
  unida a otras tantas, puede llegar a ser una verdadera alternativa a
  su destino. La aportación es individual, abierta a cada miembro de una
  misma familia, mayores y niños, cada uno decidirá individualmente si
  quiere ser solidario y comprometerse a hacer un pequeño esfuerzo o no.
  La ayuda acumulada será enviada a los mellos en forma de cuota mensual.Proponemos una Colaboración MensualEl objetivo es poder enviarles al final de cada mes todo el dinero
  que hayamos reunido. Los fondos colectados, los gastos y comisiones
  por las transferencias bancarias serán publicadas regularmente.",eduardo gonzalez,https://fundrazr.com/losmellosgonzalez,,,,,,,,,,,,

  drastic about our current ""life"" situation.  We are not
  struggling, but we are just surviving. And we asked ourselves: in 10
  years time, will we be able to really provide for our two boys?  The
  current situation on South Africa is not dire, but it certainly isn't rosy!So we did the only thing we could in these situations: we prayed and
  sought God's heart.  After many prayers, many CV's sent out, closed
  doors and back against the wall: we felt led to make a BIG move: we
  decided to emigrate to Australia. (Just a bit more info: we tried many
  other avenues, but none opened up.  The only door that opened WIDE was
  the option of moving to Australia)The last hurdle we face now is raising enough funds to actually make
  this move.  We plan on selling all we have, jump on a jet plane and
  start from scratch on the other side (many people before us has done
  this and lived to tell the tale).So literally every penny we have is going towards this.  But sadly,
  it still won't be enough.  We need an extra nudge (or nudges) to make
  this possible.So dear family, friends, aquaintances and the

KEG Fund for Derby!,"So, there has been some expressed interest in getting a keg (or kegs)
  for Derby again this year- last year, we drank almost 2! Well, with me
  having been off work for a bit, and us going on vacation at the end of
  the month, we can't really afford to cough up all of the $$ to get
  kegs ourselves. Several people had said they would like to kick in to
  get one, so I thought that this would be a good way to raise the money
  pre-Derby! I set the goal at $150- if we hit fairly close to that, KEG
  ON! And, of course, if we get close to having enough for two, there
  shall be 2! If by some chance we don't get anywhere close, I'll give
  the donors back their money, or they can choose to donate it to the
  party! So, there ya have it- there's no set expected donation- $5 a
  person would get us going if we have enough people kickin in! :)",Dana Lane,https://fundrazr.com/6kPca,70%,$150,$,105,5,Years running,3,"Louisville, KY, US",6,7,7,4

Collin and Karsyn's Wedding Fund,"On January 13, 2014, the love of my life decided he was ready to
  spend the rest of his life with me. If anyone had told me one year ago
  that I would be planning to walk down the aisle, I would have either
  chuckled in their face or ran away screaming. I had spent the better
  part of the previous year in treatment for an anxiety disorder and an
  eating disorder, and romance was definitely not on my to-do list. When
  I met Collin, it was undeniable and somewhat terrifying how much I
  instantly cared about him. He saved my sanity and stole my heart.Collin is in a band called Merriment with one of his four sisters,
  Christie, and they're planning on releasing their first full-length
  record at some point early this year. He's probably the most talented
  human being I've ever met, and his passion knows no boundaries.By day, Collin works as an apprentice for an electrical company in
  our town, Tyler, Texas. He works 30-50 hour weeks when he's home and I
  couldn't be more proud of him. We're so grateful he had this job, and
  he began around late September/October of 2013 and had attempted to
  save as much money as possible for our future.Unfortunately, that sum isn't as large as we hoped; it's large enough
  to possibly support us in the beginning months of having an apartment
  and buying groceries. It's around $1500. Realistically, with my total
  savings weighing in at a bit under $3000, a wedding and honeymoon are
  looking slightly scary, especially because after this tour, I will be
  in between jobs (hopefully not for long)!So here we are. Nineteen and twenty years old, madly in love and
  attempting a wedding this year. On my blog,http://BlissBranch.wordpress.com/I
  recently debated the possibility of starting a fundraiser to raise
  whatever money we could, because I was nervous that the message would
  come off weird! We really just want to express our gratitude to
  whomever wants to just donate $1! Anything! Any support would and
  could help us with out wedding and with our future.Thank you so much for considering us and our cause! If you want more
  background on us and our story together, please visit my blog link in

Paige Snider's Recovery Fund,"Dear Friends and Family,As many of you already know, on October 13, 2013, our our 19-month
  old granddaughter, Paige Snider (daughter of our son, Kent), had a
  tragic accident, in which she was kicked in the chest by a quarter
  horse, while at her mother's home in Reedsville, West Virginia.She sustained three broken ribs, a broken spleen, bruised lung, and a
  tear in her stomach. In addition, due to the development of abscesses
  and infection, Paige has undergone two critical operations on her stomach.THANKFULLY...she is currently recovering nicely but is not out of the
  woods yet, as she has been stepped down from ""critical"".
  However, Paige will need to stay in the hospital for at least one more
  week and will need 24X7 home care for several months once she is
  released. Needless to say, there will be quite an amount of uncovered
  medical expenses incurred as a result of this accident.You can help by making a donation, of ANY amount to Paige's recovery
  fund. All proceeds will go to easing the huge financial burden of
  un-covered medical expenses, rehabilitation and recovery costs, lost

Please help save the Fiesta,"My family and I are from Louisiana and owned fish and seafood
  markets, I have never received unemployment or any kind of government
  assistance in my life. I have had a job since I was 16 years old. I
  met the love of my life when I was 38 and married her, we have 7
  beautiful children in our blended and loving family. On September 12,
  2009, my wife, our son and our six month old daughter was in a vehicle
  on their way home one evening from my wife's job and a man that never
  had a ticket or any accidents came across the road and hit my family
  head on. My wife suffered severe head injuries and my son and daughter
  must have been shielded in God's arms because they were not hurt in
  ... I sold one seafood market and a quick oil change to pay the doctor
  bills, because my wife was suffering from trauma induced seizures from
  the head injuries. I have two seafood markets left and one fishing
  boat,and It was April 20, 2010 when the Trans-ocean Rig that was
  operated my BP exploded. This eventually killed our business and we
  did all we could do to stay afloat. We filed claim after claim that
  was always denied and until this date still has not been paid. We
  studied everything very closely and instead of loosing our home to
  foreclosure, we sold it and made $9500.00 off of it after paying the
  mortgage off and we moved to Progreso, Mexico, were we heard it was
  cheaper to raise a family, but there is not much work or money there,
  and we needed to open a business of some sort to support our family
  (at this time two of our older children were in college). I sold my
  shrimp boat and bought the Fiesta and moved to Cozumel, for the
  tourist industry and about three months ago, I finished the Fiesta,
  after working on her as I could. About three weeks ago, I put the
  final epoxy marine grade flooring down and then last Friday during a
  storm, she gave away and ended up on the rocks. I have done all I can
  do to save her, I finally got her to the dry dock and when they lifted
  her, more damage was caused. I'm lost, I don't know what to do. This
  boat was built in 1972 by Mr. Ray Davis, I was told it was one of his
  first boats, it has also been told to me that it was a Oregon Inlet
  boat. I know she is tough. I could use the help to save her if any one
  can help, this is the way I take care of my family. Thanks for your time.",Starling Johnson,https://fundrazr.com/8y3ze,0%,$35k,$,100,4,Years running,1,"Cozumel, QROO, MX",4,4,18,5

  to be torn down. He was take to the hospitral for burns suffered while
  trying to save some of his belongings and only has the clothes on his back.Please help me provide him with much needed funds to get back on his feet.Thank you!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Below is the story fromlohud.com...UPPER GRANDVIEW – Firefighters battled a fire in a house that doubles
  as a book store off Route 9W, with billowing smoke visible from the
  Tappan Zee Bridge and road closures in the area Friday afternoon.Route 9W is closed in both directions between Old Mountain Road and
  Broadway in Piermont. Orangetown police are warning drivers to avoid
  Route 9W south of Route 59 and north of the New Jersey state line.The fire was reported shortly after 1 p.m. in the house at 1050 Route 9W.The home was evacuated and firefighters fought the blaze from the
  outside, said Rockland Deputy Fire Coordinator John Kryger.Officials said homeowner Fred Rosselot, 82, ran back into the
  building to retrieve belongings and suffered serious burns. He was
  taken by ambulance to Nyack Hospital.Part of the roof collapsed and the rest of the home was heavily damaged.The residence also houses Fred Rosselot Books, which is described as
  a used book shop open by appointment. It has 30,000 books, according
  to records.Firefighters reported that books fueled the spread of the fire.Jack Dunnigan, owner of Pickwick Books in Nyack, said he has known
  Rosselot for more than 40 years.Rosselot is a retired geologist who collects and sells old books
  dealing with science and Western thought.""He's a very smart guy,"" Dunnigan said. ""He's
  well-known in the book world.""Firefighters initially had difficulty getting enough water from
  hydrants in the area. They had to enlist a pumper from Valley Cottage
  to get water from a Nyack Water Department hydrant near the New York
  State Thruway overpass at South Broadway.That water was pumped into the United Water system and used to put
  out the fire.Numerous fire departments were called to the scene, including Nyack,
  Piermont, Central Nyack, Orangeburg, Sparkill, West Nyack and Valley Cottage.Other departments on standby in Nyack include Haverstraw and Congers.
  Pearl River is standing by in Sparkill. New City is standing by in

  suffered tragic damages due to an electrical fire in the attic.
  Fortunately, they were awake, investigating the strange smells and
  activity with the fuses. Both Jenn, Dwight and all of their family
  pets made it out safely. The fire team meticulously placed their
  belongings in the middle of each room under a tarp before ripping down
  each ceiling. Although, this saved their family heirlooms, photos,
  etc., most of thier living items have been ruined by smoke or water damage.Though, we are confident that insurance will be a great assistance in
  rebuilding their home and replacing their belongings, this will take
  several months, if not the better part of the year.I am sure all of us could use any assistance during such a stressful
  and trying time. There has been such an outpouring of desire to aid or

  hard time in his life.  He never pictured having to fight for the
  right to be with his own son & pay thousands of dollars to do so.
   Legal fees are expensive & dads usually have to put up a good
  fight.  It doesn't matter if they are equally as good of a parent or better.In December,Skylerbecame involved in a custody battle over
  his 19 month old son,Odin.Atemporaryschedule allows time withOdin2 days/week for 5 hrs & 2

  forth twice/day plus a good portion isOdin'snap time.This temporary schedule may even be reduced; to be determined at the
  next court date, March 30th.  Being the father, he would typically
  receive ""access"" to Odin.THAT'S NOT FAIR!No good parent should ever just have ""access"" to their own child!Odin's mother qualifies for legal aid butSkylerdoes not.
  Yet he doesn't make enough to afford a lawyer.  It is soWRONG
  -the outcome ofOdin'scare could be based on who
  can last the longest in court!!Our brother is a great guy, friend & father.  He works night
  shift but will stay up to replace a transmission for his sister or

  is offended when you offer.  He's always there when you need to talk
  or need help no matter what.  He is extremely hard working & will
  make whatever sacrifices necessary for his family.  He is caring,
  calm, patient & puts others ahead of himself.Most importantly,Skyleris anawesome

  all of his time with him. It is hard to plan/do things

Help my family survive the war in Ukraine!,"My name is Svitlana and this is my personal appeal to help my sister
  Barbara, and her two little girls aged 4 and 5, and my Mum to survive
  as refugees in Ukraine.Two months ago Barbara and her two girls were forced to leave their
  home town of Luhansk, in Eastern Ukraine, and travel across the
  country in search of safety. You may have heard of the conflict in
  Luhansk, but what is reported is a much diluted version of the
  reality. Innocent citizens are killed on daily basis, infrastructure
  is destroyed.Barbara left home town with two bags and two children, most of their
  possessions had to be left behind. I cannot begin to imagine what it
  must feel like to have nothing in the world, to flee your home and not
  know where you will live, how you will eat how you will secure a safe
  future for your children. I also cannot believe what has happened to
  the place I was born, streets I walked down as a child have been
  destroyed  and people I knew have been killed. No one should have to
  face the war especially a child.Barbara was one of the lucky as she escaped before the worst of the
  violence, but the price she has paid is the loss of everything she
  had. As a single Mum Barbara’s life was difficult enough, but now it
  is almost impossible and she has two children looking to her to fix
  everything and make it safe.Barbara desperately needs help. Unfortunately the possibility of her
  coming to live with me in the UK is unlikely due to visa
  restrictions.  What I can give is not enough for her to rebuild her
  life and create a new and safe life. She struggles to house, cloth and
  feed her children.Anything you can give, including advice or contacts will be much appreciated.Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.",Svitlana Cartwright,https://fundrazr.com/6oeHd,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hunter Needs Your Help to Stay #hunterstrong,"On December 7th, 2013 Hunter, a fifteen year old child, suffered a
  spinal cord injury during a wrestling match.  Initially he had no
  feeling from the chest down.  After five days in ICU he was
  transferred to The Shepherd Center in Atlanta, GA where he still
  remains in an outpatient day program.While we do not yet know what the future holds regarding Hunter and
  his recovery, we are hopeful that he will one day walk again.  And
  while we have medical insurance, unpaid expenses, modifications,
  equipment and continued rehab bills continue to stack up.  We're now
  on a quest to make sure Hunter has everything he needs to be
  independent and achieve his goals as he returns home. The costs
  involved in full recovery from Hunter's injury will be astronomical
  even with insurance.As we are a family of faith, we ask first that you pray for peace,
  direction and healing for Hunter and everyone involved with his care.
   We have a long road still ahead with many uncertainties and your
  thoughts and prayers alone mean a great deal to us.  Next, please
  continue to reach out to Hunter via calls, text, ,cards, letters,
  email and social media. The interactions that we have had breath life
  into us all especially Hunter because it motivates Hunter, gives him
  hope and keeps him connected to the world rather than feeling
  isolated. Please visit the Facebook page ""Prayers for Hunter
  Garstin"" for ways to reach out.  Last, we ask that you give what
  you can to assist financially. Remodels on Hunter's home are in full
  swing thanks to the generosity of John Montgomery with The Carbine
  Company as well as Watson's Flooring and The Restoration Group. Your
  donations will help the family continue to make needed adaptations and
  renovations as well provide Hunter with equipment that will maximize
  his rehab potential at home. Your continued prayers and support are
  helping us move through each and everyday. Our blessings are beyond
  measure. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking this

It's a miracle she survived,"I, Roman and Kasia are the parents of our 4 year old daughter Julia,
  born on June 13, 2010.Our daughter had a horrible accident which happened on August 13,
  2014. She fell out of our 4th floor apartment building window in
  Mississauga on Lake Shore Blvd. She pushed out the mesh screen that
  was installed in the window and fell out on the ground. The emergency
  units came right away and rushed her to the local hospital. Then right
  away she was transferred to Sick Kids Hospital downtown Toronto. She
  was listed as in critical condition for 3 days. She had several life
  threatening injuries. She couldn't breathe on her own, had internal
  bleeding from her liver and her spleen, collapsed lung on the right
  side, and multiple fractures to her upper spine, hips on both sides,
  and her shoulder. She was on life support, was kept sedated, and in an
  induced coma for a few days to prevent her from any kind of movement,
  with a breathing tube in her mouth down to her throat, and a tube
  through her nose down to her stomach. She was in an intensive care
  unit for several days. She has a burst vertebrae in her upper spine
  that is most significant, which is the T3 disk that burst the liquid
  and is located behind the neck. She also has a couple of other
  fractures on her upper spine. She has multiple thoracic and cervical
  spine fractures , right clavicle and scapula fractures as well liver
  and splenic laceration.She is now in a cast from her ankles up to her chest and wearing a
  neck brace, and will stay in them for several weeks until all heals.
  She has troubles sleeping, eating and drinking, and she gets very
  angry that she can't move and she still doesn't realize what has
  happened to her and why is she like that.Our beautiful, sweet daughter Julia was a very happy full of life
  little girl before her horrible accident happened... Now she doesn't
  even smile anymore. It is very sad, yet she is such a miracle child to
  have survived such an unfortunate accident!Once Julia's cast and neck brace will be removed she will require a
  lot of physiotherapy treatments and extensive and lengthily
  rehabilitation. Unfortunately, it will cost a lot of money and is not
  covered by OHIP and we do not have any insurance coverage. Due to
  financial difficulties our savings have depleted and we do not have
  any more money saved since I am the only one working for my family.We are kindly asking for your help and support for our daughter who
  needs it from all the kind, caring and considerate people like you.
  Our Julia needs all the support she can get for her therapy so she can
  again be a happy, energetic and playful little girl, full of life and
  positive energy, and be able to fully walk, move, play, and dance once
  again, like she used to have.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping our little angel.

The Lyman Children's Fund,"In June of 2014, my very dear friend Sarah lost her only brother in a
  tragic car accident.  Frank Lyman III left behind a wife and three
  young children. This was one of those losses that has really affected
  me personally even though I myself was not close to Frank (though we
  do share a birthday! )  I have been wanting to do something for his
  family for some time. Because I didn’t want to just give them money
  and I didn’t want to just ask my friends and family to donate, I came
  up with this idea (inspired by a fundraiser organized last year by a
  friend of Frank’s).Here’s my win-win proposition: I have several items that I have or
  will hand make for you in exchange for your donation. That means I get
  to craft, which I love, and support a family that needs our help. At
  the same time you receive one (or more) of my fabulous crafts, and you
  help Frank’s family too. Perhaps it’s actually “win-win-win.”I have listed the items below and posted photos of examples. Please
  let me know if you have any questions about the items.  If you do not
  want anything in return (except the great feeling of helping), feel
  free to make a straight donation.  Any and all money collected will be

Help Needed to Buy Used Van for Em Due to Accident,"This Past December my 12 year old daughter Emily (who is
    diagnosed with Rett Syndrome) and I were in a car accident due to
    bad weather. (Fortunately we were not injured).UnfortunatelyOur 2002
    Wheelchair adapted Minivan was written off as a Total Loss.Fortunately our 9 year old mechanical lift is salvageable. The
    insurance company is giving us peanuts for the Van but they have
    agreed to store and put the lift into the next Van we purchase.We are almost out of time with the rental Van they gave us and
    having a Van without a lift has shown me how impossible it is to
    transport Emily Without an Accessible Van, especially as we live in
    a rural area.Her advanced scoliosis, height and age (12) makes sitting in a car
    seat impossible.I have been off work on a medical leave of absence for over 4
    years and I am on a fixed income.With the income my husband makes we have just enough to get by and
    are not in a position to apply for a loan or to borrow a large sum
    from family or friends.We have resourcefully scrounged together everything we have
    (including selling things on eBay) but it isn't going to be enough
    to get something reliable to last us until we have to visit other
    options when she outgrows the system we have. We are hoping to get
    5-6 years out of this next vehicle.I want to be clear that we aren't buying a new vehicle, nor are we
    replacing the lift system. We are looking for a vehicle that our
    lift can be transferred into without any additional vehicle
    modifications that are unnecessary at this time as she is still
    quite small.Emily has some important appointments coming up as we are
    preparing for the surgery she must have on her spine. I need to get
    us back into an accessible van as soon as possible.We know with the holiday season just behind us that things are
    tight for everyone, and that many of you may have similar struggles
    but when I found out that FB offers this fundraising assistance I
    felt it couldn't hurt to give it a shot. Any amount is appreciated,
    every dollar gets us closer to our goal.I am a firm believer in Karma, in giving what you can when you
    can, and in random acts of kindness. If there is anything I can help
    you with in the future, just ask. I am an experienced freelance
    writer, have served on a board of directors, was a social worker for
    over 10 years and I am very creative and resourceful.We would like like to thank you in advance for any assistance you can
  offer, even if it is only to read our story and pass it along. There
  are a lot of resources on the Internet about Rett Syndrome and if my
  campaign helps to educate people about this rare neurological genetic
  disorder, all the better.With warmest regards,Kristin Everitt",Kristin Everitt,https://fundrazr.com/7vZKf,33%,$3.5k,$,"1,160",4,Years running,8,"Pelham, ON, CA",1,14,23,2
"It's the 2014 Woodzie Portapotty Fund, ya'll!","You may recollect that we did a big push for funds last year, to make
  some permanent improvements at the Woodzie site (mainly bathrooms and
  a stage). Those plans are still in the works.We made good progress this year in the planning for permanent
  bathrooms, but hit a snag with the plan to tie into the existing
  septic. So we were unable to complete the permanent bathroom solution
  in time for this year's event.But check out the beautiful design
      that Woodzie-er/Designer Rolando Garcia drew up for us!We will be regrouping on the permanent solution, most likely adapting
  this design to work with a tank rather than flushing into the septic
  (perma-potties, if you will). So in the meantime, this year, we have
  the need to rent again.The cost to rent 4 units plus one cleanout during the weekend is
  $650. (I've added $50 to this goal, to cover the fees that Fundrazr
  and Paypal skim off). While we have an anonymous sponsor willing to
  cover the expense, this is quite a chunk of change for one person to
  shoulder, so would like to spread it around a little. We'll also have
  buckets for cash donations at the event.Any funds above the goal go into the existing funds we have set

  before Her opening night, so we'll be concluding donations in the

  while there's time!!! :DThe initial idea is to send Her a huge flower arrangement with the
  saying ""You're Perfect Idina! Your Fanzels love
  you!!!,"" because of the hashtag we've been trying to
  trend, among with Twizzlers if we manage to have them delivered at the
  same flower shop we are in contact with so they can make it all one
  package. After getting the flower arrangement (from a New York City
  flower shop), we'll send it to the theater She's been rehearsing for
  ""If/Then"" and let the joy fill Her heart.It goes without saying how much She deserves this and many more
  gestures of love. She's been in our lives for so long and She's saved
  many of us. So now it's our turn to return some of the love She's
  showed us. We can't do this without you!!!We'll include a list of names of the fanzels who participated if

  del concert pot variar) a continuació sumeu-li el RIDER TÉCNIC i és
  desorbita a uns 8000€. Si ens quedavem aquesta data, ens ho deixaven
  per 4000€ peró encara faltava incloure-hi els 1000€ del ""lloguer
  el equips especials que nessesiten RIDER"". Els hi hem estat
  plorant, i ens han dit que per aquesta data que ens ofereixen, per
  3000€ ens el poden fer. Així que per 4000€ els podem tenir a la província!!S'han de aconseguir vendre 250 entrades mínim, per a tal de que
  vinguin. Si sen venen mes, o a taquilla és destinaràn els diners

  risc!! (Alternativa, informar-nos d'un servei mes efectiu que hi hagi
  per internet!!)Per què s'ha de organitzar un concert d'aquestes dimensions a BOTE?Descripció:Els organitzadors de la sala el Mas de Banyoles, hem rebut moltes propostes de grups, cantants, bateries, guitarristes, etc.. del voltant de tota la província de Girona demanant-nos que organitzem CONCERTS guapos, i els ajudem a PROMOCIONAR-SE!!El que hem DETECTAT quan hem organitzat concerts de 1era divisió. És de que si que és RENTABLE i POSSIBLE organitzar-vos'en 1 cop al mes concerts de qualitat. L'únic factor DETERMINANT és la relativament alta ""INVERSIÓ"" que s'ha de fer respecte el POC benefici que aquestes activitats generen.Trobar INVERSORS no és cap problema, en tenim una llarga llista, que estàn ANSIOSOS a ""APOSTAR CALERS"" i a que els hi portem auténticas GANGUES. El problema estar en el BENEFICI, aquest tipus de apostes genéren uns beneficis molt baixos, respecte altres apostes que els hi arriben a les seves agendes.Els INVERSORS busquen DOBLAR, són com ludópates, no pas ""procuradors d'activitats socials"". Si els hi expliques, de jugar a una ruleta on ""si falles el numero"" perds els teus diners, i si encertes recuperes la aposta, no és gens atractiu per a ells i n'hi s'ho pensen en voler tornar a jugar.Si voleu que és garantitzin una CONSTÀNCIA mensual d'aquest tipus de events durant l'época que sigui que duri la crisis. Només serà possible, si HI HA aquest tipus de conscienciació del POC BENEFICI que genera organitzar concerts d'aquest calibre. O ens organitzem ""Els clients"" o els empresaris, no ho organitzaràn.Els preus de les entrades són molt cars, no?Descripció: Aixó és relatiu. El cost és el que és. Aquestes bandes, són PROFESSIONALS, és dediquen les 8h ""del curru"" assejant, i millorant les seves habilitats. Venen de molt lluny, el materials que és requereixen són molt cars. Nosaltres som AMANTS d'aquest tipus de música, no sortim gaire sovint. Currem dur, i estem liats tot el mes. I disfrutem molt mes pagant 15€ per una experiéncia mensual BRUTAL!!, que pagar 3€ per viure una experiéncia MEDIOCRE.Carpe Diem!Així és falta de organització?Descripció: Creiem que si. Per aixó hem ORGANITZAT tots ""aquests"" cabos sueltos, que corren desamparats. I els hem volgut lligar i concentrar-los en un sol punt.

  six years ago.  By coincidence, we determined that he comes to Canada
  every summer - a migrant worker on a local peach farm, very close to
  our home in St. Catharines.  We vowed to keep in touch and a
  friendship was born.  We visit often while he is here, including him
  in social occasions with family & friends.  On another trip to
  Dominica we visited his home, met his wife, Maureen and children,
  Britney & Len, and spent time with them exploring their island.
  Our worlds are so different, yet we have come to feel that we were
  brought together for a reason.Hurricane Erika devastated the Commonwealth of Dominica in August of
  2015 with flooding and landslides.  Campbell Village, home to Fagan
  & his family, has been declared a disaster area and all residents
  are being forced to relocate.  The government is implementing a
  program to subsidize the construction of new homes to land owners, but
  Fagan cannot afford the purchase price of a building lot.  Fagan has a
  down payment but no collateral assets.   His bank doesn't consider his
  annual income as a migrant farm worker to be sufficient to secure a
  loan.  On behalf of this family, we are appealing for your assistance
  to help them find the funds they need to relocate & rebuild their home.Our challenge to family and friends.When total contributions reach $500 we will match it with a donation
  of $500.",Larry Janzen,https://fundrazr.com/715ed8,8%,$4k,$,330,0,days left,6,"St Catharines, ON, CA",1,10,19,6
Please help me pay my sister's rent.,"My name is Rebecca. I'm a drop out university student that spend my
  days lazing about at my parents' place, visiting my siblings and
  sleeping. But you see, this isn't about me. It's about my sister. Her
  name is Angelica, and she's my twin. We've always been a bit
  competitive, fought a lot while growing up and I'll never forget when
  she stained the carpet in our shared room with barf when we were kids.But I love her. She was my pillar during most of my school time and I
  always had someone to play with thanks to her. During high school,
  however, the roles were reversed. Sadly, I didn't make as good a
  pillar as she did, and while I wish I was enough, the world doesn't
  work that way.She moved to an apartment back in late October last year, wanting her
  independence and I think partly to prove that she could do it,
  regardless of her struggles in daily life. She was diagnosed with
  Aspergers years ago, and because of her difficulties, she doesn't
  often have the heart to put her foot and down and say enough is enough.We have a system here, a system supposed to help people, but instead
  she's suddenly told this year that unless she gets a doctor to give
  her sick leave, she won't get any kind of grant at all. She was never
  given much, but it covered her rent and food and she was able to live
  off of it.Now she has enough money to last through February, if she's lucky,
  and after that she has no idea what to do. The psychologist she saw
  didn't take her seriously and now she's stuck trying to figure out
  what to do and stressing herself out because she doesn't have a lot of
  time to solve it in.I want to help.I want to help her.But I'm a drop out student living with our parents. No matter how
  badly I want to help her, I lack the money to do so. This is why I
  want to ask foryourhelp.This fundraiser is to help her pay her rent, for hopefully two more
  months, so that she can sit down, take a breath and be given some time
  to work things out, instead of being evicted because she wasn't taken seriously.The money that this will hopefully raise, will be going straight
  towards paying my sister's apartment rent, internet bill, insurance
  and electricity bill. What's left will be given straight to my sister
  for food and other necessities, and if the goal is reached, should
  help her immensely.Every little bit helps. Whether it's a dollar or twenty, a hundred or
  a thousand, it'll still mean the world to me, and hopefully to my
  sister as well (though she might be too shy to admit it, haha). Even
  if you can't donate, shares are appreciated just as much, because they
  increase the chances of the goal being reached.Please, donate and/or share if you can, and in return I'll shower you
  with virtual hugs and kisses.I've seen people come together to do truly amazing things for others,
  saving lives and helping the poor and so many other things. I believe
  that while this might not seem like a lot, it can put a real smile
  onto my sister's face again, and that means something.To me, to our family, to our friends and to her.Thank you for your help, and know that whoever you are out there, I'm
  truly grateful.~Rebecca",Rebecca Knudsen,https://fundrazr.com/115vf7,23%,$1k,$,230,0,days left,4,"Värmland, Gävleborgs län, SE",1,23,14,5
Hair Today...Gone Tomorrow!,"If you care about freedom of religious expression, protecting
    children from emotional trauma, social justice, or father's rights,
    please support me by contributing whatever amount you can to this cause.My seven-year-old son has been growing long hair since birth. Until
  recently, he kept a long braid, in the Native American tradition, as a
  source of pride and strength. For some American Indians, like my son
  and me, long hair is an outward symbol of faith; our connection to
  everything past and present, and to the physical and spiritual worlds.
  I have worn my hair long all my life, knowing that the only reason to
  cut it would be because of the death of a very close loved one, to
  symbolize my loss of strength and allow me to recover while it grew
  out back to its long length.Recently, my son's mother (with whom I share 50/50 legal and
  physical custody) decided on her own to cut off over a foot's length
  of hair against his wishes and mine, despite knowing our views.
  Because of the way she cut it, my son's hair can no longer be worn
  in a traditional braid. My son now feels as though he has lost a part
  of himself and has told people that he ""does not like himself as
  much as he used to."" I am trying to teach him our indigenous
  culture, through words, but because he is still so young, I must rely
  on the adults around him, and my own role-modeling, to help him build
  his sense of Native American identity.I filed a motion against his mother in our county courthouse to try
  and stop her from cutting any more of his hair. My case was based on
  the fact that “religious training” is considered a ""major
  decision"" in our parenting plan, so keeping my son's long hair is
  part of his religious training. Unfortunately, the judge decided that
  because ""cutting hair"" was not specifically mentioned in our
  parenting plan (although this was not my argument), the child's mother
  did not willfully violate the terms of a court order. This is as good
  as giving her permission to do it again, not to mention a
  discriminatory dismissal of Native American religious practice.The New Hampshire family courts currently do not recognize
    that the keeping of a braid is an exercise of religion by Native
  Americans,despite established case law(see below).To protect my son from further emotional harm and to preserve his
  right to practice his beliefs, this coming May 2016, I have a court
  hearing to establish that the cutting of a Native American child's
  hair should be treated as a ""Major Decision"" by the family
  courts. The cultural beliefs of American Indians should be recognized
  and afforded the same protections as the tenets of other more
  established faiths — for example, the wearing of a yarmulke and
  sidelocks for Jewish man, or wearing hijabs for Muslim women, or
  performing baptism for Christians, or wearing long hair by Sikh men.This case may go to the NH Supreme Court and set legal
  precedent, but I can't get there without your support! The
  ACLU will not take cases involving family court matters.
  (And four years within the family court system have bled me
  of resources.) All donations will go to pay for legal fees.If you cannot help financially, please contact me about being an
  “expert witness” on these matters.Thank you!!!================================Betenbaugh v. Needville Ind. School
    Dist., 611 F.3d 248 (2010):The district court had “no difficulty finding that some Native American communities assign religious significance in hair length,” and that Arocha had shown “that he himself has these ‘deeply held religious beliefs.’ ” Arocha had made this showing, the court concluded, not only because he “has not cut his hair in ten to eleven years” and “[h]is long hair addresses ‘fundamental’ and ‘ultimate’ concerns,” but because “[h]e describes his hair as ‘an outward extension of who we are and where we come from, our ancestry and where we're going in life.’ ” This echoes the district court's undisputed findings of fact, which we repeat once again: “[w]hen people ask A.A. why he has long hair, he tells them it is because he is Native American...”================================Below is a video of my son (in blue jeans) playing with other
    Native American children before his braid was cut off. He now
    asks, ""When will my hair regrow?"", but I cannot
    promise that it won't be cut again...",W Fox Tree,https://fundrazr.com/515zd0,2%,$12k,$,275,3,Years running,7,"Keene, US",1,26,19,1

Rubens Rainforest Reunion,"Hi ThereWell where do I start? A year ago, I was at work as normal, when a
  customer, Rachel, and her son, Ruben, came into my workplace. Having
  recently moved to Devon from Ireland she was inquiring about local
  knowledge and we started chatting. From that meeting, we became friends.During the last year, I have seen and been on the receiving end of
  the hand of friendship that Rachel extends to anyone and everyone she
  meets.  She has become an integral part of the local community and has
  seen me and others through some difficult times in the sort time I
  have known her. Whenever I see her, in her busy schedule, she is
  always on some mission or another that involves helping someone or
  some animal in crisis.Rachel has also, in the last year, made a success of not just one
  business, but two, from scratch and works tirelessly to provide for
  her son Ruben. She runs her own dog training school here in the local
  community, following her passion for animals and providing force free,
  welfare friendly dog training and behaviour. With her motivation as
  always, to save dogs and families the heart ache of re-homing their
  pets due to behavioural issues.  She also has a second business, face
  painting, which keeps her ticking over.https://www.facebook.com/pages/THE-WORLD-OF-FANTASIA/7061630582https://www.facebook.com/learntospeakdogRachel has also chosen to home educate her son Ruben. As she is a
  single mother, her decision to home educate has meant she has no
  option but to be self-employed and make it work, no matter what.Having seen the struggles a single woman has to deal with in her
  daily life, just to make ends meet and having met Rachel and seen the
  convictions she has for her beliefs in education, across the board,
  her strong beliefs in attachment parenting, animal welfare and
  reaching out the hand of friendship to those in need, I felt it would
  be a fitting tribute to both herself and Ruben to give the general
  public a glimpse into the life of a single woman on a mission to
  provide for her son and give others a chance to celebrate that by
  supporting her with a small token from us, her friends,  by way of
  helping her to reunite with the father of her child who lives in the
  rain forests of Borneo.So, with the support of her other friends I have set up this
  fundraiser. Ruben’s Rainforest Reunion. The story below gives us a
  glimpse into where this whole story began.RUBEN'S RAINFOREST REUNIONBack in 2009, Rachel was working in Borneo at Sepilok’s
  Rehabilitation centre. She was the liaison officer working on behalf
  of one of the UK based charities that financially support the centre.Rachel worked alongside the volunteers at the centre and rangers
  employed by the Sabah Wildlife Department. All working for a common
  cause to insure the successful rehabilitation of one of the most
  endangered creatures on this planet. The Malaysian Orang-utan.During this time, she became very close with a Ranger. He was single
  father to four children, who worked alongside the Orang-utans for up
  to 14 hours a day. Rachel fell in love with his integrity for his job
  and his children. And so the love story began.When Rachel’s contract came to an end in Borneo she was due to renew
  it for a further year with the charity. However, due to political
  unrest within the sectors, she was flown back to head office in the UK
  where she continued her work to support the orang-utans. However, not
  long after her return, she realised she had come back with a little
  surprise. That surprise was who her friends and family know today as
  Ruben Wan Meadows. Rachel and Irwan’s son.Rachel birthed Ruben in Ireland, with the support of her mom.
  However, with the economic downturn of the Irish economy Rachel made
  the brave decision to move to the UK and start a completely new life
  for herself and her son. Facing homelessness on several occasions
  since having Ruben, she has fought against all adds to get herself to
  where she is today. She has come through some fantastic struggles in
  her life and continues to work hard every day to better herself
  spiritually, mentally and physically. As a single mother in today’s
  economy, she continues her struggle on a weekly basis to put food on
  the table and a roof over her head. Is would be highly unlikely she
  would ever have the opportunity to provide the funds to reunite her
  son with his father.In 2012 Rachel managed to take Ruben to see his Dad in Borneo, as
  Ruben travelled for free.Ruben and Rachel have maintained constant contact with Irwan over the
  last 6 years.Ruben was only two years old at the time of his visit. However, he
  still remembers his dad, and his exciting adventure in the rainforest.Due to the financial constraints of both Irwan and Rachel, being
  single parents, it is highly unlikely that they will ever be able to
  meet again. Ruben is of an age now, fast approaching 5 that he dearly
  wants to see his Dad again.  Time passes so quickly and after
  maintaining contact for so long, a reunion of Father and son is so
  desperately needed.I think I can speak for all of Rachel and Ruben’s friends and family
  when I say that they are two very deserving people of such a gift of reunion.So, having come full circle, this brings me back to what the
  fundraiser page is for. Through donations and other events held
  throughout the summer, I hope to raise the profile of Ruben’s plight
  and the funds to enable himself and his mom reunite with Irwan and his
  four other beautiful children later this year. Given the financial
  status of Ruben’s father and four other children in Malaysia, I will
  endeavour to raise enough money to buy his family beds to sleep on and
  any other basics that they are in need of.Ruben is so excited at the prospect of seeing his father and to take
  with him, enough funds to help his family have the very basics in
  their home to make their life just that little bit easier.Anyone who has met Ruben, or understands the importance of the bond
  between Father & Son, will hopefully see this as a worthwhile
  cause. We are looking at auctioning of some drawings, organising
  table-top events, sponsored challenges, and any other ideas we can
  come up with to help raise our total. We also accept donations of any
  amount, which is simple to do, through a Paypal payment.Irwan lives and works in an area of Borneo, which could be dangerous
  for Ruben to travel too. So the trip would require Ruben and Rachel,
  to arrange to meet and stay with Irwan in a safe part of the country.
  To achieve this we aim to raise £4000 for the trip to re-unite Ruben
  with his dad and a further £1000 to improve Irwan's standard of living
  and provide him with the basics for his home and family in Borneo.If you think this is a worthwhile cause, or know Rachel and Ruben,
  and would like to help them to achieve their target they hope for,
  please spread the word, share the page and highlight this cause as
  much as you can and of course, follow their progress. The Facebook
  page ""Ruben's Rainforest Reunion"" is also up and running. No
  matter how small, feel free to make a donation or support the upcoming events..Thank you for taking the time to read about Ruben’s Rainforest ReunionThere will be a list of all contributions, donations and amounts from

Please Help Ava & I End Our Homelessness!,"Help Ava & I End Our Homelessness!!!Ava & I became homeless on February 11th due to
    circumstances beyond our control.I have exhausted every city/state agency...including all
    homeless shelters, welfare offices, motels, transitional housing,
    etc.  All are either full, don't allow babies (only certain shelters
    have what they call family space), or I am not eligible for their program.At this point, I do have a family that has offered to help us
    down in Georgia.  The issue is, all of my belongings are in a
    storage unit and I need financial help to get all of our stuff down
    to Georgia.  The only belongings that are in my possession are
    literally the clothes that we had on when we were forced out of our
    home.  Luckily, I have several changes of outfits for Ava, as well
    as diapers, feeding supplies, etc for her.Uhaul U-Box wants approximately $2000 to transport the items. 
    The other option would be to rent a Uhaul truck, which would cost
    less (around $1500 - but then I would need someone to drive the
    Uhaul for me)....and then after fuel costs and mileage fees...it's
    probably about the same as getting the Uhaul crates...so that's
    probably a better option.  I have also priced out PODS as well as
    U-Pack which offer similar services and all are even more...starting
    at about $3,000.The money raised will be used to secure our belongings, get
    them transported to Georgia, and any additional funds left over will
    go towards any other incidental costs in establishing residency in a
    new state.Please, any help you can provide would allow me to have a
    fresh start and create a better life for my daughter and I.",Candice Lewis,https://fundrazr.com/616LYd,10%,$3k,$,285,3,Years running,9,"Nashua, NH, US",2,15,14,0

"Please, HELP Dasha Shishkova!","URGENT!!! PLEASE HELP!!!Please share and like these posts and ask all of your friends to do the same!! We are running out of time and your help would mean the world! If you could donate any money, even $5 or $10, it would be very very appreciated!Thank you all and God Bless you!!!My 15 year old daughter Dasha Shishkova is one of the nicest and sweetest people you have ever met. She lives in Moscow, Russia. On November 9, 2012 Dasha got hit by a car at a cross-road. She was transported to the hospital in extremely serious condition with a closed head injury and brain contusion. Dasha spent almost a month in coma. Trying to save her life the doctors performed two brain surgeries. She finally came out of her coma but now her diagnosis is changed to vegetative state. The driver who almost killed Dasha is not accepting liability for ruining her life and is hiding from the parents and police.Right now Dasha needs an urgent medical treatment at the HELIOS Hohenstücken hospital, where she has to stay for a minimum of three months. This is the only hospital which accepts kids in a vegetative state like hers. This matter is very TIME SENSETIVE and we are desperate. The medical treatment in German hospital where she has to spend the minimum of three months costs 600 euro a day ($800) and there is no way we can afford it.We believe that there are some people out there who do care. We are begging you to help our daughter. Please support her by making a tax-deductible donation to her medical treatment fund. Your contribution, even the smallest one, WILL make a difference for her.

  sometimes forget the financial strain it can be on a family when one
  income no longer exists to which brings me to ask for your help for my
  sister in-law. Trying to carry on paying the everyday bills along with
  many trips to the Toronto Hospital has been a difficult task which has
  caused her to have many days where she just couldn't go to be with her
  husband as she HAD to work. So I'm asking that if you can find it in
  your hearts to please help her with this huge burden, I would be
  forever thankful and I know she would be as well. She would never ask
  for help and so that is why I'm asking for her, please help relieve
  some of the stress of this tradgic time for her. And please keep my

Help my kids start over after this tragic accident,"Hello friends, family and strangers I just haven't met yet. My one
  daughter and her husband, Dawn M. Trim and Kevin A. Trim, from Alpena,
  MI, have been ""over the road"" truck drivers, since our son-
  in-law, Kevin, retired from spending years and years in the military.
  He served in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries. But they
  were so happy when he finally got to come home and they could work as
  truck drivers and make up for so many years apart. BUT then a tragic
  accident hit. Jan. 9, 2015, in a massive pile up on 1-94 in Kalamazoo,
  Michigan, while Kevin, was driving the truck to have repairs on it and
  traveling with just their trusty, truck dog, Grace, he was hit,  head
  on by another semi. Our precious Miss Grace, a pug that was their
  ""fur baby"" was killed. Our son-in-law, thank goodness
  survived, by the Grace of God, through that tangled mess.  They were
  packed and ready for their next run, thus almost everything they owned
  was packed in their sleeper and truck. Little was able to be
  recovered. Not even their precious, Grace. Now months of no income,
  healings, new everything, glasses to see, medications for their
  health, no belongings, no truck, now the stress and work has begun. I
  as their Momma am worried almost to the point of physical sickness.
  See, if you knew Dawn and Kevin, (Trim) like I do you would know they
  are the most giving, kind hearted people in the world. They are
  constantly giving to others they see in need across the United States.
  They have paid for down and out people to get groceries, taken
  homeless out to eat, bought gas to help a struggling Mother move her
  children to get a new start. My lists could go on and on, even though
  they would NEVER tell you how they ""pass it forward"" out of
  love in their hearts and their faith in their God who has given so
  abundantly to them. My request as their Momma, is a simple one. First
  and formost they need prayers, your warm thoughts but also they need
  to be able to eat, buy clothes to replace the only clothes they had on
  their backs, as the rest were all loaded and packed. They don't even
  have a coffee pot, way to cook, what we take for granted they have
  lost ALL!  I for one could not live without a regular pay check coming
  in for what might be months on end. If any part of their tragic story
  has touched your heart and you would feel the need to ""pay some
  forward"", I for one would be so grateful, would appreciate it SO
  much to know my children could have a fresh start. My wish would be
  after 30 some years in the military that many Vets would want to say,
  ""we are here for you, Brother."" And other organizations that
  help people start over after tragic accidents and events that happen
  to our fellow human beings, could contact them. Any help, suggestions,
  cards and many many prayers would be so overwhelming indeed.  My
  sincere thoughts, hugs and love go out to each and everyone reading

Support for Babu Baral's Family,"Published in The Express Tribune, January 7th, 2016.LAHORE:Theatre has long been symbolised by comedy and tragedy masks, but for
  Pakistani stage performers, they connote a deeper reality. As they
  take to the stage wearing an unflinching smile, luring audiences with
  their dialogue delivery and dance moves, defenseless in the face of
  jests and name-calling, they put on an act more than they act. While
  some opt for the profession by will, others have no choice but to
  perform on stage to make ends meet. Who would have thought the
  daughter of stage and comedy legend, the late Babu Baral, would face
  this conundrum?Powerless in the face of hardship, Babu’s widow Sobia was left with
  no choice but to get their 17-year-old daughter Tabeer to quit school
  and take up stage performances. “My daughter was innocent and not
  trained in dancing or acting, but it was due to our financial
  condition that she had to turn to the stage,” said Sobia. Tabeer was
  pursuing her O Levels at City School in Lahore. Since Babu’s demise,
  life has been tumultuous for the Baral family. Sobia, along with two
  daughters and two sons, resides in a rented house of 545 square feet,
  struggling to get past every day. Their lives have never been harder.But come what may, Tabeer is determined to do her best for her
  family. She suffered an injury during a performance last week but
  continued with it and has been working in different theatres across
  the city. “I injured my knee and have been in pain but I have no time
  for illness as I run my family with the money I earn through
  performances,” she said. “I am the only one responsible for the
  education and wellbeing of my younger sister as our relatives avoid
  visiting us after my father’s death,” she added.Being the elder daughter, Tabeer does her best to provide sustenance
  for her family and began with stitching clothes. She also gave
  tuitions to school-going children but “poverty and crises” forced her
  to pivot towards the stage. “I am lucky that there are still good
  people in the field and have lent their support to me in terms of
  acting and honour me due to my father. I have gotten a number of
  opportunities to perform on stage over the past few months and some
  production bigwigs have also contacted me to perform.”But the young Tabeer continues to hope for the ‘tabeer’ of her
  dreams. “I wanted to give CSS exams. It was always my dream and my
  father did his best for our education. I could have never imagined we
  would see such difficult times,” she stated. “I am educated and belong
  to a family that has always worked hard. I am hopeful that I will be
  able to pull my family out of this misery one day.”And then, she posed a question many still find unfathomable. “I ask
  the governmental authorities what they are doing for the artists of
  our country. My father spent his whole life representing the country
  and contributing to the field. It is painful that my dreams have been
  destroyed just because of poverty.” She further said, “It is shameful
  that artists are forced to send their daughters to perform on stage
  due to poverty and the onus is on the government.” Sobia added, “After
  two years of constant struggle following the death of my husband, the
  government extended support to me by offering Rs75,000.”As if it was not tough enough to venture into stage, the people in
  Tabeer’s life have not made it any easier for her. “I have made a name
  for myself on the basis of my talent but a few relatives have been
  blaming me for earning a bad name for my family by performing and
  dancing on stage,” she shared. “I fail to understand the hypocrisy in
  our society. I will make sure I do not succumb to any pressure or
  perform any vulgar songs on the stage. I am only inspired by my father
  and feel acting on stage is nothing short of an art.”Born Ayub Akhtar, Babu began his career as a comedian from Gujranwala
  and soon shot to fame with plays such asShartiya Mithayto
  his credit. He reigned over commercial theatre for around 25 years but
  governmental authorities did little to glorify his legacy. “They
  [stage performances] do not pay well enough but I am hopeful that good
  days are to come and that my daughter will be a star, just like her
  father,” Sobia said.",Bilal Khan,https://fundrazr.com/315aUe,1%,$10k,$,120,3,Years running,2,"Ajax, CA",8,8,18,3

Davis Family hopes for justice,"Hello my name is Cynthia and I am asking for your support in order to
  get our superman home. My husband, a disabled Army Veteran, was
  wrongfully convicted and is currently incarcerated int the state of
  Texas. He has proudly served his country and has never been in trouble
  with the law before. When i was 3 months pregnant with our son LJ, I
  was attacked by a man and two women. I was being pushed,hit,and
  ambushed by these three people. My husband did what he was trained to
  do and went for his weapon, which he had a license to carry.He fired
  one shot at the man's thigh and that same bullet hit one of the
  females that was with him as well. He was ultimately convicted of
  double aggravated assault with deadly weapon & was not allowed to
  claim self defense on my behalf & I was not allowed to press
  charges against the attacking party. As a matter of fact they were
  treated as victims, I a witness, and my husband the aggressor. The DA,
  Judge, and even our own lawyer have blame in this unjust conviction.We
  have recently become aware that there is hope in reuniting and
  restoring our family's good name. There is an appeal called 1107, this
  appeal will allow us to challenge the conviction if we have adequate

"He ain't heavy, he's my brother.","Last week my 61 year old brother John was admitted to hospital in
  Johannesburg, paranoid and delusional. His shoulder bones were poking
  through his clothes and his ribs were clearly visible. He had no
  identity documents and was convinced he was someone else.Like millions of his fellow South Africans he had no medical aid. A
  private hospital would have charged R50,000 (£2,500) to admit him so
  the friend I'd enlisted to find John took him under police escort to a
  state hospital where he was kept tied to a trolley in Casualty for
  three days before a bed became available in the acute psychiatric ward
  where he is still being assessed.His situation is made worse by the fact that he will be homeless on
  his release, as his landlord has evicted him, and he has given his
  bank card and pin number to some unknown person who has emptied his
  bank account. It is almost impossible to absorb the enormity of the
  devastation that has ripped his world apart. A sudden mental-health
  breakdown has come like a thief in the night and struck him to pieces.It wasn't always like this.I'd last spoken to my
  brother ten days previously, concerned that he'd begun to miss our
  Sunday phonecalls, and his regular email contact was becoming patchy.
  I knew that he'd lost the job he loved and excelled at - teaching art
  and design in a busy school - and was grieving the death of both his
  housemate from cancer as well as our mother, who died very suddenly
  last year, and that he'd fallen out with his oldest friend whom he
  usually saw every week.All these losses plus isolation, money worries and unspoken fears
  seem to have tipped him out of normal reality into a parallel,
  distorted void in which he is now trapped. The diagnoses in his first
  ten days of confinement are equally terrifying: paranoid
  schizophrenia, toxic psychosis, delusional disorder.I am all that's left of his nuclear family and I'm absolutely
  desperate and determined to fly out from England, where I live, to
  help him get the treatment and support he needs.I can afford to fund my own airfare and absence from work until
  Christmas but cannot hope to cover the costs of my brother's recovery
  and rehabilitation. Public healthcare in South Africa is almost
  non-existent, very basic and hopelessly oversubscribed so his care
  will have to be funded by me. After much deliberation and
  soul-searching I'm making this crowdfunding appeal and asking for your support.Every penny of the money raised will be spent on:emergency accommodation for Johnpsychiatric treatment and ongoing therapeutic supportliving expenses until he stabilises and can support himself again
    (as he has done his whole working life)replacing missing property and identity paperworkreimbursing the friend who has paid for cleaning, clearing, moving
    and storing belongings, and his lost paid work due to constant
    liaison between John, the hospital and myself in the U.K.My brother is no-one special. But he's my big brother and I've loved
  him since the day I was born. In all my 59 years we've never once
  fought or fallen out.He was always my champion and my protector. He taught me to ride a
  skateboard and drive a car. He is intelligent, kind, funny and
  extremely talented.Is,not was.Now he has no-one left to carry him except me.He ain't heavy,
    he's my brother. All I want to do is hug him so tight that all
  his broken pieces stick back together again, then help him get back on
  his feet and on with his life.The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in
    rising every time we fall.- Nelson MandelaCould you please help us by donating only an amount you can afford,

Support book purchases for trach families,"My name is Cassandra and my son Sawyer was born with a rare
  neuromuscular disease called Central Core Disease, resulting in him
  requiring a tracheostomy and a ventilator to support his breathing.
   Since we've started our journey I have always tried to help support
  other families through hospital life and receiving the news of
  requiring a trach and/or ventilator for their own child.  It can be an
  extremely overwhelming process for a family to have to go through.
   The parents are always trained and supported from other medical
  professionals and other parents who have gone through it to help the
  transition to a new way of life a little easier, however, for the
  sibilings, other family memebers or even those that come across their
  lives there isn't the same training/support available.  This is where
  my fundraiser comes into play.  I have had the honour of meeting a
  fellow trach/vent Mom from the US who created and published a book
  that in my mind helps the process of a tracheostomy not seem as scary.
   This book explains everything about the trach and even how the lungs
  work.  All well keeping it very easy for children to understand.  This
  book can also be a huge help for those siblings to bring to school and
  share what theyve learnt to help promote inclusion and understanding.What I am trying to do is purchase as many books as possible (my
  current goal is 50, but I'd be happy with 5) to have them available
  through our local Children's Hospital and have them given to any new
  families going through this new life changing event and those families
  that already live in the community with a trach.  I have already
  donated 2 books to our hospital and I can't wait to be able to donate
  more with your help.  More information on Mattie and his book can be
  found here:https://www.facebook.com/MattieBreathes/This book is also a wonderful way to remember Mattie, as he was such

Help us celebrate Addison's life!,"Addison is a beautiful quadriplegic who suddenly went into cardiac
  arrest on January 18, 2014. Since her horrific accident 13 years ago,
  she has encountered many surgeries and hospitalizations but we refused
  to allow her physical limitations to hinder us from including her in
  everything. She was always so full of life and never wanted anyone to
  be sad or upset. Addison’s current hospital stay began in early
  November, forcing her to miss Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, and
  the Sweet 16 birthday bash we had planned. We promised Addison that we
  would still have her HUGE party when she was released to come home,
  however, due to the cardiac arrest she has suffered extensive brain
  damage. With this said, it is with great saddness that the family will
  be forced to remove life support next week. Our precious angel will
  soon get her wings and we want to celebrate her by giving her the
  beautiful princess gown she has longed to wear. We are asking for

Desiree Bruce Brain Injury Recovery Fund,"Help Desiree Bruce's recovery from a Traumatic Brain InjuryDesiree is an inspiration to all whose lives she has touched
  throughout her adventures. She is a two time breast cancer survivor in
  her short 33 years.She has had a lifelong passion for horses, making many friends along
  the way. She has competed in Horse Trials throughout the Pacific
  Northwest during her riding career. Desiree has taken several horses
  from the race track to their second career as riding horses and
  competing in the sport of eventing.Desiree brought several of her passions together when she started
  'Jump For A Cure' to raise breast cancer awareness and funds
  throughout the eventing community.http://eventingnation.com/home/chesna-klimek-eventers-jump-for-a-cure/The Accident -Why are you reading about Desiree?On March 7, 2014, Desiree was in an accident while riding her 17+
  hand grey gelding, Quinn. They were enjoying a ride with their friend
  when Quinn tripped and fell. Although Desiree was wearing her helmet,
  she suffered a traumatic brain injury.Desiree spent 19 days in a coma. While in a coma she battled
  pneumonia. She had a tracheotomy and feeding tube, couldn’t talk,
  could barely communicate (through mouthing words) and had no control
  over her limbs.When she started physical therapy 6 weeks after her accident, she had
  only limited control of her right arm. Within 5 weeks she was standing
  and taking steps with the support of her therapists.  For those of you
  who know Desiree, this is no surprise.For the last month, Desiree has been in Harborview’s acute therapy
  in-patient program. The program consisted of physical, occupational
  and speech therapy, 5-6 sessions per day, 6 days per week.She was discharged last week and is now entering Harborview’s
  out-patient intensive therapy program.  We will know more about her
  therapy program in the next week once her therapists have finished
  establishing her new baseline, goals and treatment plan.Expenses - How can you help?While Desiree is in rehabilitation in Seattle, Andrew, her husband,
  is by her side every single day. They are both being supported by
  their families and close friends. Although she has long-term
  disability income, the living expenses and non-insurance covered
  medical expenses are mounting.They have three Jack Russel Terriors and a German Shepard they call
  their children, as well as two horses, that are currently being cared

Help Lester with his Passion to be a Pilot,"Early
  Christmas Day of 2009, I got a text telling me that my brother Lester
  had been in a horrible car accident.He’d lost control of his car on slippery roads and hit a rock wall in
  a T intersection right in front of the EA Games company in Burnaby,
  BC. Unfortunately, the car engine bay caught on fire and there was a
  fist-size hole on the windshield, through which the flames rushed into
  the car, causing devastating burns to his face, chest and arms.The fire fighters pulled him out of the burning vehicle and the
  paramedics saved his life by performing something called
  cricothyrotomy (slicing open my throat to insert a tube) for breathing
  because his face was swollen due to the burns.After countless of surgeries and with the support of his friends,
  family, doctors and therapy, I could slowly see the old Lester coming
  back. He never gave up and kept on fighting for his life. With ongoing
  occupational therapy and physiotherapy, he had gradually found ways to
  cope with his everyday life.Because he had lost part of his fingers, some normal daily activities
  like tying shoelaces and buttoning up a collar shirt took a lot
  longer. Eventually he found a way to work things out and became more
  and more positive. He was strong and persevered through this bumpy
  ride. It was amazing to see how he slowly transformed himself. He went
  out and met with friends and was not afraid or shy to share his story
  when asked.During a break in his surgeries, he continued his Aircraft Mechanic
  Engineer diploma. He had to review the subjects that he had previously
  taken and some of the projects that he had to do for school took
  longer than usual because of his lost finger parts. He studied hard
  and graduated in 2011.In 2012 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee award
  for completing his school and continuing work at the military despite
  the obstacles.Lester has always wanted to be a commercial airline pilot. He had
  heard from our father stories of our grandpa flying in the air force.
  He does not want to give up his dream because of the unfortunate
  accident. Currently he is studying hard to complete his examination
  for ground school; however, the cost of completing the commercial
  pilot licence is immensely high, especially in flying time.My goal is to raise enough money to help him with his tuition. This
  financial assistance would enable him to work toward his future and
  any contribution would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for
  reading my story of my brother and his journey. I am so proud of his
  success. He is an inspiration to me.",Mandy Harkness,https://fundrazr.com/4s3b3,9%,$30k,$,"2,560",5,Years running,27,"North Vancouver, BC, CA",9,22,16,0

Help Me Stay,"I am creating this site to seek continued support in my endeavors in
  Haiti. I have been in Haiti since April of 2010. In my time here I
  have cleared rubble, demolished dangerous structures, taught safe
  efficient building skills and methods, built two clinics, built two
  additions on a nursing university, built or added to three orphanages
  and maintained the facilities of an organization base and a clinic.That was my first four and a half years here. This time out I
  have a different mission, a different direction I desire to go.
  Actually it is two directions.First, I want to call American
  churches together to support the efforts of the Haitian churches in
  helping their communities. From scripture I believe it is a
  responsibility of the church to see to the needs of the less fortunate
  and it is the duty of each church as part of the body to support the
  distant churches in their efforts to do this. This requires some time,
  more than I had realized and continued support while I coordinate
  these efforts is something that will keep me available to move
  forward.This, when I returned this last August, I believed to be
  my mission here. As I have been seeking the aid and cooperation of the
  American churches I have also been confronted by various other
  problems that slip through the cracks of the relief agencies, clinics
  and educational resources. My wife, Maricienne, is especially crucial
  in this. Besides being quite a capable administrator and coordinator
  she has a great heart for people. She engages folks on buses, in
  tat-taps, at the market, at jen and many other areas of the community.
  Between the two of us we have realized and broadcast a number of needs
  in the community and have been able to see to and assist in.We
  have provided sixty families with three days food in advance of a
  threatening storm, assisted with part or all tuition to get 10 primary
  school children and 2 secondary school pupils enrolled, we helped a
  widow return to business allowing her to become self sufficient and
  allowing her five children to be enrolled in school, this in addition
  to the other twelve. We have received partial funding now to help a
  three year old attend a school for the deaf and we are looking for
  assistance in either getting an eye surgeon nearby to do glaucoma
  surgery for a man that lives near us or to cover the costs for him and
  someone to accompany him to the more distant clinics where they are
  capable of performing this surgery.This would not be possible
  were I in the States. I understand tent making ministries and my first
  stage here was just that. Sharing the gospel through the work I did
  and using those opportunities to serve. Those opportunities are at
  present not available but the opportunities to serve are like the
  rain, falling in front of us in abundance. By supporting my family and
  myself you allow us to bring unrealized hope and resources to so many
  needs.The amount I am asking for would see to our needs for a
  year. These would include food, housing, drinking water, electricity
  and transportation in Haiti. With Haiti's visa requirements it would
  also cover my need to exit and reenter the country every ninety-days.
  I may also help allay any costs for traveling to the States to speak
  with churches in seeking their support. It may seem to you that I
  don't have my figures right, that the amount is too little. One year
  here I made $6500 and supported my family and in the first four and a
  half years I averaged $9000/year income but these were not sufficient
  to support travel outside of Haiti. The numbers will suffice.Thank you in advance for your kindness and another kindness
  would be to share this in your networks.",Raymond Shader,https://fundrazr.com/8145y4,5%,$15k,$,710,0,days left,3,"Léogâne Arrondissement, Ouest, HT",8,3,19,5

  My name is Wayne Powell, google+ name A'udhu billahi

  the world today. Specifically whats going on in Syria. Many syrians
  are being destroyed for no reason. Some of them are fortunate enough
  to seek refugee status in other counties.One such family happens to be my best friend's sister and her family.
  They just arrived here a couple of weeks ago. Her youngest son Nabeel,
  8 yrs old, was so scared from all of the bombings he went to the
  bathroom very frequently because of stress and fear. When I saw this
  my heart broke. An 8 yr old kid, broken and affraid of his own shadow.
  He is doing a lot better since his arrival to Canada.This is our chance as a race, the HUMAN RACE, to help at least one of
  these familys get a little kickstart in life. Yes the canadian govt
  does give them money every month,and although they are very thankful,
  it barely covers rent. They have no idea I am doing this charity. Lets
  put race, culture and religion aside, and recognize when its our turn

Help reunite a Dying mother with her son for Xmas,"Joshua Key is a former US Army soldier.  After witnessing numerous
  war crimes and civilian abuses conducted by his fellow American
  soldiers and seeing them go unpunished by his superiors he made the
  only moral decision available to him, namely to desert.He crossed the border into Canada in 2005. He has twice applied
  unsuccessfully for refugee status. He married Canadian-born Alexina
  Brick in 2009 and has raised four children with her. Key cannot return
  to the United States for fear of being arrested and serving a lengthy
  sentence in a US military prison for deserting and speaking out
  against the war.The Key family has just received word that his mother Judy Barker has
  been diagnosed with cancer. The doctors estimate she has three months
  left to live. In a few short weeks she will likely be too sick to travel.We are appealing to supporters of War resisters to donate what they
  can to help reunite Judy with Joshua  and the wife and children she
  has never met. The money is needed to secure a round trip ticket from
  Oklahoma to Winnipeg and back, to make sure the air travel is insured,
  and to secure travel for someone who would travel with her.Our goal is $7000 Canadian.Re-uniting Joshua with his mother for the holidays one last time
  would be a wonderful Christmas gift for him and for the whole family.

Help Keep Brittany & Mom From Homelessness,"Hello, My name is Brittany and I was diagnosed  at 14 with high risk
  leukemia in 2005.When I had cancer in 2005, My mom lost her job, lost our house
  because she couldn’t pay rent. I was inpatient in the hospital at the
  time, so we didn’t care. When I was released from the hospital, I went
  to a hotel. I lived in hotel from October 2005- February 2006. The
  state couldn’t help, they told my mom to live in the car with me,
  knowing I had cancer and they could take me away. Since I was immune
  suppressed, I couldn’t live in a shelter either. Needless to say, that
  time in my life is over with. I think we are given these obstacles to
  build character, gain understanding, and help others.Little did I know...My mom lost her job as a result of a sexual assault. She is now
  disabled. We got an eviction notice and we have to move out by the end
  of this month. Which brings me to my PTSD.In 2005, we became Homeless
  on Halloween and in 2015, we have to be out by Halloween. I really
  don’t know what to do or where to go. It is so scary. NY is pretty
  much killing me in the winter time so I don’t want to live here anymore.I was trying to keep it all in and not post anything and keep a brave
  face but now my PTSD is kicking in. I need help. I don’t know what to
  do. We just found out last week that we had to move. The landlord had
  a change of heart and wants to kick us out, at first he said it was
  okay as long as he get some money.I normally don’t ask people for help but can you help me. Please. We
  have 6 days left.I can’t eat or sleep, I’m so stressed, I know this is not good for my health.The money will help us move from New York and find a cheap, safe roof

Please help my Dad get his life back,"My name is Stacy Hawthorn. This is my Dad's story. Many people need
  money for hospital bills, or a nice wedding. This is not that kind of fundraiser.This started with a domestic dispute gone wrong. A no contact order
  and a man left with nothing.What we all know, is that anytime there is a question of harm toward
  another, the courts put a no contact order in place to protect the
  victim. What we all don't know, is that it can cost you big money to
  try to retrieve your belongings and everything you hold dear in your life.My dad was the victim of what can happen when the legal system is one
  sided. A woman that claimed to love him for 15 years took not only his
  belongings, but his heath and his self worth.The police would do nothing, stating that it was a ""civil
  matter."" The civil attornies did nothing but take his money. His
  whole world turned upside down by a woman that wanted him to do things
  he was bound by law not to do, and because he wasn't there to provide
  for her, she took everything.Now, he is left with nothing but a few scraps of clothes and some
  incidentals that she threw on the lawn. She sold all of his tools, his
  motorcycle, his car, his clothes, and his rifles that had been in his
  family for generations. She made up stories to evade having to account
  for where those belongings ended up. She has his personal
  items...pictures from the navy, family photos of his children, his memories.His efforts to retrieve these items, in vain.I know what you're thinking...if he had a no contact order against
  him, he must be a criminal, right? Not in this case. She falsely
  accused him of a crime that he proved he didn't commit, but because of
  her manipulations and spite, he has been the one to suffer, and she
  the criminal. It happens more than you might think.  That is exactly
  what happened here.Now because of this one incident, a year ago, he has nothing.
  Borrowing a vehicle from a friend so he can got to work, the furniture
  in his house mine. He has nothing to call his own.I am raising money to help him get back on his feet. To give him a
  bit of hope that life doesn't always have to be lonely and full of
  dispair...that you don't have to spend money to get things back that
  you already paid for, only to come up empty handed. I have never seen
  a man so broken.My hope is to raise awareness, for this is something that has
  probably happened to more people then we know. Men left to fend for
  themselves just for making a mistake. Left with embarrassement and
  shame for a crime they didn't commit. No one to listen, no one to hear
  their side of the story.That is where I come in. I am telling this story, and I am asking for help.I am also going to donate $100 to the women's shelter if we get half
  way to our goal. $200 if we reach it. Domestic violence is no joke, I
  have seen both sides of the damage it can do.I thought I would mention what the donation money would be used for.The most important thing is transportation. We need to get enough to
  fix the transmission in his truck or purchase a cheap vehicle for work.The other use will be the mounting bills that have accumulated from
  having to pay lawyers fees.Lastly, it will be used for basic needs, such as food, soap, gas, etc.We will make every penny count.Thank you.",Stacy Hawthorn,https://fundrazr.com/f13dY5,5%,$5k,$,260,3,Years running,8,"Port Orchard, US",11,5,6,3

Through the Fire,"My mom, Josie, fell asleep on the couch Wednesday January 14th
  because something told her not to go to bed. She was watching t.v. and
  before she knew it she had fallen fast asleep. While sound asleep she
  was abruptly woken by a firefighter saying to her, ""Ma'am, you
  have to leave! There is a fire upstairs! ""She was so nervous and
  shaken up that she had to be escorted out of her apartment while still
  processing the magnitude of the situation. She called a friend, who
  without hesitation, went to her home and picked her up because she was
  just too distraught to drive.The fire began in the upstairs apartment closet and the cause is yet
  to be determined. No one is yet to blame for the fire that was
  started. Unfortunately, my mothers apartment happened to reap the
  consequence of the flames, smoke and water damage completely ruining
  her personal property. Although my mother walked away physically
  unscathed from this horrible incident, mentally she is truly shaken up.For the past few days, my mom has been staying at her friend's house.
  She has been dealing with the leasing office, which has moved her to
  another apartment, the fire chief who assigned her a case number, and
  the appraiser from her insurance. With the help of her friend and her
  friend's family she has been clearing out and cleaning the items from
  her apartment that are salvageable. Much of her property cannot be
  saved. She has lost most of her furniture in the bedroom and living
  room, her electronics, and a lot of her clothes. Her apartment has
  been turned upside down and she is forced to move. She is working with
  the insurance company in regards to her belongings, but many of us
  know how the insurance company can be...Unfortunately, I am unable to physically be there for her at this
  time, but I would like to set up a fund where people who care can
  donate money for her to replace many of the items she has lost. I know
  her insurance will not cover and replace everything she lost. Like
  many of us, my mom has worked hard for everything she has, and it is
  unfortunate for her to lose it all. I want her to be able to replace
  it. She has made sacrifices and continues to work hard and give to
  those she loves and to those she does not even know. I would simply
  like to return the favor in her time of need.Whatever your donation, it would be greatly appreciated. She has not
  asked me to do this, and if you know my mom, she would never ask for
  anything. She would cherish every little bit that she receives. I
  would like to thank you in advance for reading this story and for
  making a donation. If at this time you do not have money to donate,

Give Frank The Helping Hand,"Dear Brothers,As many of you, if not all, have heard, our Theta Chi brother Frank
  Lyman, Dickinson class of ´90 was tragically killed this past summer
  in a car accident. Frank was on his way to pick up his two children
  Thomas and Aislin, ages 9 and 11, at summer camp when another car
  veered into his lane and struck his vehicle head-on. His wife Keira
  and 5 year old daughter Carys were saved thanks to the quick action of
  first responders and skilled medical teams. Keira and Carys face a
  long road to full recovery, in particular Franks wife who faces a
  possible year-long hospitalization, many surgeries and rehab. I can’t
  express just how severe the injuries to them were.Frank, full of life and promise was in the prime of his life. He had
  woven a successful career path and had years of further success ahead
  of him. He was a beloved father who put his family first and would
  have provided security and quality of life for his family. Frank was a
  champion of people and an exemplary Theta Chi. He was a friend to all.
  He excelled at bringing people together.Frank was the sole provider in his family, who could now use our help.I feel compelled that we, his Theta Chi brothers, should do something
  to assist his family under these extraordinary circumstances. Our
  fraternity was founded on the principle of“friendship through the
    mutual assistance of every member”. Will you please extend“thehelping hand”to Frank’s children? Some of you may have
  already individually donated to the fund established for his children
  and the family is very thankful. I was hoping you would also be
  willing to make a donation here that would represent Theta Chi as a
  whole to be put toward The Lyman Children fund.Make any donation you can here to FundRazr.Please share this, but only within Theta Chi.Θηρόποεα ΧείρThank YouFernando GiacominiTheta Chi “89 Dickinson CollegeFrank's Obituary:Frank Trenholm Lyman III, 46, of Austin, Texas, loving and beloved
  husband, father, son, brother, and son-in-law, died early Saturday
  morning, June 21, 2014, as a result of injuries sustained in an
  automobile accident on the outskirts of Austin. A vehicle traveling on
  the wrong side of the road hit the Lyman family's vehicle head-on. The
  two other passengers, Frank's wife and youngest daughter, survived the
  crash. Born June 11, 1968, in Boston, Massachusetts, Frank moved to
  Columbia, Maryland, at the tender age of six weeks with his parents
  and older sister. Following his childhood in Columbia and graduation
  from Centennial High School in Ellicott City, Maryland, he attended
  Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from which he received a
  B.A. cum laude in English in 1990. After graduation Frank began work
  in publishing, excelling in sales and marketing roles with Prentice
  Hall both in the Washington, D.C., area and in Englewood Cliffs, New
  Jersey. In 1995, he returned to school, receiving an M.B.A. from the
  Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia in
  1997. He spent the next year working for Procter & Gamble in
  Cincinnati, Ohio, as an assistant brand manager on the Cheer account.
  Frank was the fourth employee and vice president of marketing of
  Herndon, Virginia-based LifeMinders, the first e-mail marketing
  company, from 1998 to 1999. He then entered an association with John
  Wiley & Sons through 2007, working as vice president of new media
  development in New York general manager of Wiley Canada, and vice
  president of marketing in Hoboken, New Jersey. It was during this time
  that he met the love of his life, Keira Roberts. They married on June
  2, 2001, in Washington, D.C. Frank took his marketing savvy, digital
  media expertise, publishing experience, and love of learning to new
  levels over his remaining career trajectory. As executive vice
  president for marketing and business development for CourseSmart, the
  first eTextbook platform and a venture jointly backed by several top
  publishing houses, he led development of eTextbooks for the iPhone app
  and grew the student eTextbook business to $10 million in sales from a
  zero base. In 2010, he then joined LibreDigital in Austin, Texas, as
  chief marketing officer, heading up product management and marketing
  for this leading distributor of digital content. Most recently, and
  until his death, Frank served as chief product officer for MyEdu
  Corporation in Austin, launching the first professional profile for
  college students and managing institutional partnerships. MyEdu was
  acquired by Blackboard in December of 2013. Both in work and in his
  personal life, Frank was unparalleled in the strength of his
  connections with others. His solicitous nature, ability to listen, and
  extraordinary sense of humor and perspective drew people near and kept
  them close. His inventiveness, intelligence, vision, and wisdom led
  him to ever-increasing career heights. Friends and family from
  Washington, D.C., Columbia, Montclair, and New York to Austin,
  Cincinnati, and Toronto have been buoyed by his friendship and cheered
  by his infectious grin. A music aficionado, Frank played guitar and
  sang. He displayed a distinctive sartorial flair and brought both
  style and wit to everything he did. A father and husband of absolute
  integrity, his top priority was to create and maintain a safe, rich,
  and full life for his beloved family. Frank is survived by his wife,
  Keira Lyman; daughter Aislin, son Thomas, and daughter Carys; father
  Frank T. Lyman Jr. and mother Sandra Lyman of New Hope, Pennsylvania;

  quick to learn and try new things.  Bobby is very smart.  At the age
  of 10, he started his own business on craigslist fixing technological
  devices.  He is a bright kid who has made some poor decisions. His
  parents (mostly his mom) worked very hard to provide for Bobby and his
  brothers.  Therefore, they really didn’t have that stay-at-home
  parental figure managing a lot of their choices. This led them to make
  poor decision and fall into bad situations.  Recently, Bobby got into
  some trouble with the law and that is why we are creating this
  account. Currently, Bobby is facing a 24 year sentence in prison. We
  are unable to speak on the case at this time but we can say that it's
  a self defense case taken too far.Therefore, we ask you to please look deep inside your heart and
  help us out with a donation towards getting Bobby a Lawyer. Give Bobby
  a fighting chance.  Bobby is a great asset to our family and we are
  crippled without him.  We depend on him to take care of his nieces and
  nephews who are only just babies.  He also cares for his grandma by
  taking her to doctor appointments and running errands.  He has been
  trying to get his life together by recently obtaining a job.  With
  your donation, you can help us get him back and save his life.  Thank
  you so much for taking the time out to read this and to donate.  We

Support for Olive,"Olive is a four year old girl in reception at Deeping St James

  faces many challenges but has a very special, independent can do
  attitude to life and touches the heart of everyone she meets. Olive
  was born with one half of her body significantly smaller and weaker
  than the other. This has caused a variety of problems for Olive where
  her legs are different lengths and had to have her right foot
  amputated to enable her to walk using a prosthetic leg. Olive has
  Scoliosis due to her uneven body growth, uneven hips and torticollis
  causing her to hold her head to one side causing her difficulties with
  balance and fatigue. Olive has a smaller right hand and arm with some
  bone abnormalities which causes her difficulties in daily life. Olive
  was able to have a ride on a Tom Cat Trike, a special needs trike
  which is custom made and adapted for her needs. It enabled her for the
  very first time to cycle, much to our amazement and joy! Olive could
  sit safely, with her posture and spine supported, and adaptions made
  to accommodate her prosthetic leg and knee positions which are at
  significantly different heights. Not to mention she absolutely LOVED
  it!!! We are fundraising to purchase Olive a Tom Cat trike which will
  give her the joy and freedom to cycle like any other child, improve

I love my family,"Hi, my name is Jamie and I am 39 years old. I am engaged to a great
  man and we are expecting a baby boy in April. I also have a wonderful
  17 year old son who I couldn't be prouder of.Right now we are having struggles. We were living with my parents
  because my dad has stage 4 bone cancer. We were helping them with
  everything. The cancer took a toll on my dad mentally and he fell off
  the deep end on Thanksgiving. It was more than I could handle. I
  invited a hospice social worker over to the house to talk with me,
  because I realized it was finally time to reach out for help. Things
  hadn't been good for a long time, but Thanksgiving was a breaking
  point for me. She had some good ideas and validated my feelings, which
  helped me. She expressed to me what I already knew; that it was time
  to move out if we could.The final breaking point was on 12/2/15 when dad gave our room away
  to a houseguest. The evening prior to that it was discovered that the
  apartment has bedbugs. It will need to be fumigated. We are now
  staying in a motel, week to week, until we can afford the monthly
  rent. At the motel, our room is warm, the bed is comfortable, and it
  even has a kitchenette. I would like to continue staying here until we
  can save enough to rent our own apartment. I am grateful to be here. I
  have peace for the first time in a long time. Even though this is
  physically a stressful time for me, I believe it is better for my
  unborn baby to have a mother with peace of mind and less mental
  stress. My sore back and legs the baby can handle. Emotional and
  mental stress isn't good for an unborn baby.We are continuing to go to work every day but our income will not
  quite cover the cost to stay here. I am asking for help with paying
  for one month of rent, which is $950.00. That would be a huge
  blessing, jumpstart, and miracle, causing our problems to literally
  disappear. But at minimum I am asking for help with our phone bill,
  which is $200.00. The phone bill being paid would be an enormous boost
  as well. Once these basic needs are met, we have the income to make
  it! We just did not expect to have to move out overnight and did not
  have the savings to cover these expenses.I am not one to ask for help in this way and I am embarrassed that it
  has come to this point. But I also know when it's time to swallow my
  pride and humble myself. We really need help. I have a lot of hope, I
  have been praying, and I know God won't let me down, and that I won't
  let myself or my family down. I applied for a second job last night. I
  have a lot of footwork to do next week. I am willing to do whatever it
  takes, no matter how hard it is, and how many tears I shed. I won't
  let this break me.Thank you for anything you can do for us, no matter how small it is,

A sister's fight for Justice,"First I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to read our
  story. My name is Victoria, I would like to introduce to you my sweet,
  caring and very loving baby brother Jeremy.  I could not ask for a
  better brother and uncle to me and my three children. On Monday December 7th our lives changed forever. My brother was
  brutally assaulted in his own home by a man that had been asked to
  leave the home where he and his Mother reside. This left Jeremy with
  severe injuries to his face and head. He was transported via ambulance
  to Bridges Medical Center in Ada, MN where he was treated for his
  injuries. They performed a CT scan due to the severity of the wounds,
  which, thank the Lord came back with good results. It took 10 stiches,
  2 internal stiches and 4 staples to close the horrible wounds to his
  face and head. After all the stitching and stapling and CT Scans were
  done to close his wounds he was put in handcuffs and transported to jail.Jeremy was scared  and alone while trying to protect himself in his
  own home where we all should be able to feel safe and not threatened.Jeremy is a very shy, some may say Socially Inept young man. He is
  very uncomfortable going into public for long periods of time and
  finds himself equally uncomfortable in the company of strangers. With
  that being said, he is currently unemployed and has very little money
  to go toward the overwhelming costs that come with fighting a legal battleI ask all our Family and Friends,. Please find it in your hearts to
  help Jeremy with the costs of retaining legal counsel to prove his innocence.I would like to ask anyone reading our story to please pray for
  Jeremy to have all the strength, love and support to carry him through

  request, they promised Rose that they would take care fo her girls.Deb and Charlie made several trips back and forth from Grand Rapids

  a larger home, Charlie spent nights and weekends remodeling their home
  by adding additional bathrooms and bedrooms.  This past June, the four
  children moved to Grand Rapids with Deb and Charlie.The children all come from different orphanage's in China.  None of
  the girls are related to each other, and all were either dropped off
  at an orphanage or found abandoned on the streets. The children were
  given American names at adoption, Aimee, 20 Halle, 20, Jaide, 17 and
  Rachel, 15.Aimee was adopted in 2003 by Rose at the age of 9.  Aimee is now 20
  years old.  She has graduated from high school, and is currently
  enrolled at Grand Rapids Community College as a sophomore.  She loves
  tennis, reading and riding her bicycle.  Aimee has a physcial
  disability in that she does not have a right leg below the knee and
  missing all of her toes on her left foot.  When she was adopted she
  was fit with a prosthetic leg, and, as she was growing, revisions and
  further prosthetics were obtained.  Her current prosthetic leg does
  not fit correctly, due  to her growth, and it is failing with a large
  crack.  Rose met Aimee when she was adopting Rachel, as Aimee was the
  caregiver for Rachel in the orphanage.  Rose could not bear leaving
  behind Aimee, so she adopted Aimee as well.Halle was adopted in 2006 by Rose at the age of 12.  Halle is now  20
  years old.  She has graduated from high school, and is also currently
  enrolled at Grand Rapids Community College as a freshman.  She loves
  making origami and riding her bike.  Halle writes beautiful poems and
  could publish her poems if given the chance.  She hopes to get a job
  as a translator and wants to go to college to study computer
  engineering.  Halle likewise has a physical disability.  She was badly
   burned as an infant and does not have full use of her right arm.Jaide was adopted in 1998 at the age of 9 months. Jaide is currently
  17 and attending Forest Hills Central High School in Grand Rapids.
   Jaide is a very talented artist and is just beginning to understand
  the artistic gifts that she has.  Jaide is participating on the High
  School swim team and honor society.Rachel was adopted in 2001 at the age of 2.  Rachel is currently 15
  years old.  She is also attending Forest Hills Central with a 4.0
  grade point average.  Rachel enjoy reading, playing the flute and
  wants to be a doctor.  Rachel has a physical disability in that she
  does not have right inner ear canal.  She has had multiple corrective
  surgeries over several years, however, she remains deaf in her right ear.All four girls are wonderful individuals, and Deb and Charlie have
  taken to raising the girls with all their heart.  They exemplify
  selfless, genuine and kind people.  My husband Jovan and I know the
  Kirts through some of their grown children.  We admire their energy,
  adaptability and strength.We approached the Kirts to ask them if we can do a fundraiser for the
  girls. We know that raising a child is not without expense, and here
  Deb and Charlie have four.  While you are getting ready for the
  holidays this year, can I ask you to please find it in your heart to
  make a donation to this amazing family.  Deb and Charlie are very
  giving people, and they would not ask for the financial help for the
  children, so I have taken the initiative to ask you to help the girls.Thank you and have a blessed holiday season.",Charles Kirt,https://fundrazr.com/0u4Xe,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please help support Jeff and his family!,"In January of this year Jeff was given the devastating news of being
  diagnosed with grade 4 Glioblastoma Multiforme (a malignant type of
  astrocytoma which is a brain tumor of the central nervous system).
  This is terminal with a life expectancy of 14.6-18 months. To prolong
  the time he does have he has been undergoing chemotherapy and
  radiation daily. Between the chemo/radiation and medication it has
  taken a toll, not only on Jeff but the entire family.Jeff is a loving, hard-working husband, an incredible father of two
  young girls and a caring friend.   He is always happy to help anyone
  in need and gives himself full heartedly to the good of his community,
  church, and daughter’s school and family. Men like Jeff are rare, he
  is one of a kind in everyway. He is a selfless, kind and gentle soul
  that should have had the privilege to live to be 100. The tragedy of
  not being able to watch his children grow hits Jeff and those around
  him the hardest. Anyone who has had the pleasure of getting to know
  Jeff Funnell, count him as a blessing and are humbled by his amazing
  spirit of giving. He continues to show great strength and dignity
  through his illness and is what the family is clinging to.To really understand how amazing Jeff is you only need to watch the
  face of his children light up as he enters the room. Jeff is truly a
  bright shining star that will continue to glow in the eyes and smiles
  of his two sweet little girls. Words seem to fail somehow in
  describing the footprint Jeff has on his girls, his wife, and all
  those he touches.We need your help! We want to help Jeff and his
  family in any way we can so that we can alleviate some of the
  financial stress, one of the few things this family should not have to
  worry about at such a difficult time.   Please show your support to a
  wonderful family and remember that no donation is too small. We will
  be forever grateful for your contribution.May Jeff and his family share many more wonderful memories together

  where it was discovered he was having a severe brain haemorrhage and
  was immediately taken into surgery. The doctors were concerned that he
  wouldn't make it through the operation. Thankfully he did and he was
  put into an induced coma to aid his recovery.Rob exceeded all of the health professionals expectations and over
  the next couple weeks he was taken off ventilation, his sedation was
  reduced and he was brought out of the coma.He has gone from strength to strength since then and although his
  movement and speech are affected very severely, he is making some
  astonishing progress.Rob came out of intensive care and In order to fly back to the UK,
  needed to receive costly, specialist treatment from a rehabilitation
  centre in Sydney so he was fit enough for the flight. Rob has now
  flown home and his rehabilitation continues which is putting a large
  financial burden on his family.At the end of January I will be running the Sun Run (10km from Dee

Aiden Treatment Fund,"Aiden was only two years old when he fell into his babysitters
  pool in August of 2011. His brain was severely damaged due to the lack
  of oxygen from near drowning. The doctors did not think he would make
  it, and if he did he would not have normal function and be rendered
  unable to do anything on his own ever again. One doctor told Aidens
  mother that his soul had gone but his body was still here, and asked
  if she was prepared to do whatever necessary to care for him and since
  that day, she has.In the last two years since the incident Aiden has made huge
  strides in the way of progress. Aiden can now hold his own head up and
  makes consistant efforts to communicate by using a handful of words
  that he has learned. The doctors determined Aiden would also remain
  blind, however Aidens vision as progressively improved and recently
  discontinued use of his glasses. Through hard work and regular therapy
  Aiden is improving balance and function and sits upright on his own
  for several seconds at a time. He has suffered tonic-clonic (as well
  as two other types) siezures and, to the surprise of his neurologist,
  has defied odds by overcoming them on his own without any medicinal treatment.Through determination to help her son, Aidens mother found
  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Treatments (HBOT) that are used to treat and
  heal brain injuries. The HBOT works by carrying oxygen through out the
  body, stimulating the release of substances called growth factors and
  stem cells which promote healing. Research shows the outcome of HBOT
  as 15 times greater than therapy alone. Aiden has completed his first
  round of treatments  and has shown a positive reaction to these treatments.Although these treatments prove to be effective they are not
  covered by insurance and are very expensive. Doctors estimate Aiden
  will need between 60-120 treatments total depending on rate of
  progress. The family is accepting donations to help pay for these
  treatments, 100% of the funds collected go towards Aidens treatment expenses.Thank you all for your hand in helping Aiden continue his fight

  called around and found a friend to run him to the vet. I spent the
  next hours wishing I could be there with him and getting there as
  quick as I could. When I arrived I waited outside for a while because
  they had the door locked because it was after hours and finally
  someone came out and let me in. The doctor came out with a look on her
  face that broke my heart. I have never heard the word severe so many
  times BUT she also informed me that he had survived so far which was a
  very good sign . She told me if I wanted to try to save his leg I
  would need to drive about an hour away with him to where they had a
  specialist . After paying my bill there I drove down to hope
  veterinary specialists in malvern, pa. They spent a few more hours
  cleaning his wounds all the while assuring me that at this point chief
  would be fine . It will def be a healing process and at this point I
  still don't know if they can save his leg but they are going to try.
  Chief is being such a fighter.the bills I have been quoted including
  what I already paid the vet who saved his life come to $13,300-16,300
  which can change depending how surgery goes but at this point it's a

  Yvonne Begaye-Padilla and her spouse Gerald Padilla, were struck by a
  drunk driver, both of them passed at the accident scene. This happened
  back home in Utah on the Navajo reservation. They were traveling with
  my 14 yr. old niece, Naomi Woody (my sister Doris' daughter), who
  survived the accident but she was critically hurt. She is currently
  recovering in Albuquerque, NM with her parents at her bedside. My
  sister Yvonne is survived by her two children, Donovan and Lavonda. My
  family is torn apart by this terrible tragedy, especially around this

  function is very limited.Step and learn children's charity has been instrumental in improving
  his hand usage. They are a small charity in Kent but children come
  from many miles to use them. They offer a totally free service, seeing
  Jude once a week since he was 6 months old. They are struggling for
  premises due to finanaces and we want to help them!www.stepandlearn.orgfor more info.The second part of this fundraising effort is something called CIMT
  or contraint induced movement therapy. Previously this was only
  available in America, but.... GOOD NEWS!! It has come to a therapy
  Centre in Manchester. The treatment is not cheap but it has been
  proven to increase usage of the affected limb by up to 80%! Nothing is
  as affective in children with Jude's condition. It does not come cheap
  as it involves a three week stay with 2 physio staff for 4 hours each
  day.www.cimt.co.ukfor more info.We are aiming to raise money so that both Step and Learn, and this
  new therapy, can help Jude to use his hand as much as possible.Many events will be posted on here. Currently we have Linda Humphrey,

Giving the middle finger to Multiple Sclerosis,"As some of you may or may not know, last summer, whilst 3/4 of the
  way through his training to become a pilot with Oxford Aviation in
  Arizona, my brother, Sam, was diagnosed at the age of 24 with Multiple Sclerosis.Sam was immediately placed on the next flight home, and had to endure
  11 hours alone before reaching England, coming to terms with not only
  that his life was about to take a stark change in dynamic, but that
  his hopes and dreams, 10 years in the making, were now crashing down
  all around him.I can still hear the silence around me when I found out, a million
  miles away in Uganda, that my brother 'Pilot Pile' may not be a pilot
  after all. I ask my friends at the time 'what is MS?' and the answers
  sent a chill down my spine. I knew at this moment that things were to
  become very difficult for me and my family, so I set off on the next
  flight home, too. Despite seeing my family crumble and struggle to
  come to terms with this news, I can only be thankful for how we have
  all stuck together, and throughout this turbulant year maintained the
  view that 'everything happens for a reason' - although this has been
  hard to understand at times, I now believe this more than ever to be true,After 14 restless months, pay check after pay check, medical after
  medical, set-back after set-back, Sam was finally granted his full EU,
  UK and USA medicals back to allow him to legally fly again. Although
  there are restrictions and Sam has to have a medical much more
  frequently than most other Pilots, and he will have to fly home once a
  month for his medication (hail the NHS!), Sam is finally allowed back
  to Arizona to complete his course. However, things are not as easy as
  they seem. Although we finally have the grace of Sam's Pilot's License
  back, Arizona seems more distant than ever before. It is almost
  impossible for us, a family of 5, to fund this, but the thought of Sam
  giving up on his dream which so nearly fell through our grips is
  unbearable - if that happens, what will all the tears and despair have
  been for?Between discussion, my family and I have come up with the idea of
  trying to fundraise for Sam. It is becoming hauntingly clear that
  Multiple Sclerosis can drastically alter the direction of Sam's life,
  but I want him achieving his dream to be a huge part of this - because
  why should two letters and a couple of inadequate nerve cells affect
  one of the most dedicated and deserving people in my life reaching
  their goal?The course was always going to be financially difficult, but 14
  months ago it did not seem inconceivable, however having been set back
  a year it is looking increasingly tough. Obviously we do not have
  £100,000, and by no means to we intend to raise £100,000, but even
  £100 would be a huge head-start in where we stand today, as I am
  writing this. In the course we are looking at around £120,000 - to put
  this into perspective, that is £10,000 a month for a year, 6 deposits
  on a small house, or 80,000 loaves of bread. The figure itself is
  simply inconceivable.All we are asking is for Sam's friends, family and loved ones to take
  part in this to help raise some money. Even a pound or two is an
  immense help in our cause - as they say, every little helps. Please
  spread the word to your friends and family and anyone who wants to
  help Sam find the light at the end of the tunnel. Even if the sum
  isn't a huge amount statistically, I believe it will restore Sam's
  faith and give him the push and inspiration he deserves to ensure he
  will not give up on his dream.Your help is greatly appreciated and your kindness not overlooked.Thank you beyond all measure.In the words of Anne Frank, ""no one ever became poor by giving""",Molly Pile,https://fundrazr.com/d13MH3,105%,£1.8k,£,"1,840",3,Years running,53,"Rochford, England, GB",10,13,20,1

Christmas for the Berry's!,"Hello all!!I am friends with a super amazing family, and I wanted to do
  something to help with their struggle this Christmas. They are an
  airforce family living on one very small income. And like many people,
  they have fallen into debt that they are working tooth and nail to get
  out of. Nearly every last penny goes to paying bills, and what little
  is left goes, quite frugally, towards food. Sometimes, they can't even
  afford formula.The mother stays home with the girls, and can't return to work as
  they pregnant with number three. The father is an Afghanistan Vet and
  is still in the Airforce. They have two girls, 4 & 1, and the
  father has an older son, 12, who spends Christmas with them every year.Lately times have been especially tough; the government has cut
  benefits to the public medical system and to family assistance. The
  mother is not covered under the father's military insurance, so they
  have to pay for all doctors visits out of pocket. Their parents
  recently rallied together to buy them a car, as their people mover
  unexpectedly quit earlier a few months ago.Some years you're on top of the world and others beat you down. These
  kind, hilarious, good natured people are not on top at the moment.The other day the mum said to me that she didn't know how she was
  going to be able to pay her car rego, let alone be able to pay for
  Christmas for the kids this year. In a perfect world, the holidays
  would not be about material possessions, and I know they are thankful
  they have each other and will make Christmas special regardless, but I
  would love nothing more than to be able to help them get the kids a
  little something.I asked her how much she needed to do Christmas for the kids, I
  expected to hear $500...and you know what she said? $200 would be more
  than enough to make Christmas nice for all of the kids! This year
  hasn't been great for us either, but I know for a fact, that I have
  something to give, and that maybe I could find some others to chip in too.Every little penny counts and even if all you have is $5, I know it
  will make a difference!! At the end of this fundraiser, I will buy a
  Target gift card for them to buy presents with.Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and happy holiday too!! Please
  don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!!Much love,Alicia & familyP.S. The extra $50 is for the fundraising fees. Every last cent aside

Mobility for John,"13 years ago, on 28 November 2001,John West’sheart
  stopped . . . he was 28!He was found dead by his friend who administered CPR while waiting
  for the emergency response. The Medics managed to revive John through
  defibrillation of his heart but it left him in a coma for 2 months.
  This was followed by a 5-month period of rehabilitation during which
  time he had to learn to walk again.Since an internal condition (the stopping of his heart) blocked
  sufficient oxygen-rich blood from reaching the brain, John suffered astagnant anoxic brain injury.This condition is also called hypoxicischemic
  injury (HII) and resulted (to varying degrees in John’s case) in:Ataxia, or a lack of coordination. This often expresses
    itself as a sort of bobbing or weaving, similar to what is seen in
    people who are drunk.Spasticity, rigidityandmyoclonus, disorders
    which can include a tendency toward jerky motions, trembling of the
    extremities, or other abnormal movements.Quadriparesis, a weakness of the arms and legs.John is now 40!He lives with his mother and sister in the sleepy (almost) Karoo town
  of Worcester, Western Cape and is predominantly dependent on their
  availability and movement to get around as walking long distances if
  very challenging for him.I see him in the Worchester Motion Fitness gym at least 3-times a
  week and I enjoy his sense of humour and intelligence and whenever I
  can, give him a ride home after our workout. The other two days he
  works at Golden West Casino Lodge where he sorts dirty linen for R68
  per day. This, together with his disability grant of R1 300 per month,
  is barely sufficient to get by but despite his meagre means John has
  beensaving-uparound R250 per month in order to get
  a car. It is going slowly and he will most probably have to have the
  car modified and re-apply for his driver’s licence. Things that will
  take time (at the going rate it will take him around33 years
    to save-up R100Kfor a car which will make him73-years old). While this is taking aSho't
  Left(i.e. going nowhere slowly) he is dependent on whoever can
  offer him a ride, or who is willing to take a bit of a detour.Because of John’s willingness to help himself, love of life and
  courage to get out there and experience life I decided to launch this
  initiative on his behalf and with his consent. I always listen to him
  in the gym going around to people asking them; “Is there a lift
  today”? . . . And can only imagine how difficult it must be to
  always look to other people for your mobility.Let us share our good fortune and get him an Electric Mobility
  Vehicle for Christmas (see the product options below).Not only will it to a large degree solve his mobility challenges and
  better his chances of securing a more stable and lucrative job, it
  will go a hell of a long way to improve his independence, dignity and self-worth.We urge you to help us with this quest to help people who care enough
  to help themselves.All we need is around 500 people who have it their hearts to
      pledge around R100 each and we could have John on the move by
      Christmas(hence the deadline of 12 December). . . and have some cash to spare for another worthy cause!(See the cost breakdown below.)Payment optionsI apologise for the fact that the money is collected in USD but this

Please Help Us Pay for Graham's Expenses,"July 1996 - our lives changed forever. Graham, our brother, son,
  husband, father, and friend was in the back of a van that rolled off
  the road. A split second error by the driver and 2 broken vertebrae in
  Graham’s neck (the two people in the front of the van had no
  injuries)……left him a quadriplegic. At the time he was self-employed,
  an avid golfer and martial arts enthusiast, married to his high school
  sweetheart Karen, the father of three very active boys – ages 2, 3 and
  5, and he owned his own multi-level home.Graham was flown to Vancouver General Hospital’s Spinal Cord Unit
  where he spent the next 6 weeks.  It was here that we all began to
  understand what the ‘new’ Graham would and would not be able to do…..
  Karen and the young boys - in a state of shock, had to leave their
  home and move down to Vancouver to be with him. The stress on all of
  them was enormous – the boys were reluctant to leave their mother’s
  side and couldn’t understand what was really happening.  The
  grandparents took turns taking care of the boys so Karen could spend
  time with Graham, and the rest of us took turns being at the hospital
  24/7 so he wouldn’t have to be alone!It was also at this time that our dad – Gordon – traveling back to
  Kelowna from Vancouver was in a car accident where he broke his back –
  luckily he was not paralyzed, but he was put in a brace and told to do
  nothing for many weeks.Then to GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre in Vancouver for the next 9
  months – learning how to cope and manage within the new constraints.
  Initially he was on a ventilator as only the top third of his lungs
  were working.  He learned to use a sip and puff system for his
  wheelchair and to turn on and off his TV and work a computer.  Again –
  as a family – we all tried to help.  We made sure that someone was
  with Graham everyday – until he went to bed.In April of 1997 Graham and his family returned to Kelowna. They had
  had to sell their multi-level home and purchase and renovate a new
  accessible one.  They all had many changes and challenges to deal with
  – new neighbourhood, new friends, new home…..new Graham…..Although the challenges have been great Graham has maintained an
  amazingly positive attitude and a tremendous sense of humour. He is a
  caring husband and a very involved father to his three sons. He was an
  assistant coach for his sons' soccer teams, he never missed a practice
  when the boys were in martial arts, and he has supported them in
  sports and academics through school and into their post-secondary paths.Graham has had tremendous support from his community and family for
  the past 18 years - especially from his wife Karen and his parents
  Gordon and Vivian. The support has come in many ways.He receives a very modest monthly income from his settlement and a
  stipend from CISL to pay for the attendants he requires.  Karen works
  full-time at a seniors care centre. These earnings are acceptable for
  regularly incurred costs – mortgage, food etc., but not enough to
  cover the costs incurred as a quadriplegic. Unfortunately they have
  had to borrow and re-mortgage to manage.As a quadriplegic the needs and costs for virtually everything are
  much greater than even a paraplegic – wheelchairs are more, beds are
  more, lifts are needed, a specially equipped van is required…….and the
  opportunities to assist with the costs are much more limited.Everyday items have to be converted or adapted to meet his needs. His
  telephone and his TV have all been adapted to work with a sip and puff
  system. His home had to be retro-fitted to accommodate his wheelchair
  - the hallways, the ramps, the bathroom, the doorways, and the
  bar-type screen doors.  Graham has learned how to maneuver his
  wheelchair with a toggle even though his hands don’t work, he uses his
  shoulders and upper arms. For his 50th birthday he received an iPad -
  a truly amazing tool for him - operated with a specialized mouth stick.Costs are extremely high - a specialized wheelchair accessible van is
  required - costs range from $40,000 - $70,000 (even for used). His
  current van is 18 years old with a hydraulic lift - both the van and
  the lift need constant repairs and neither are any longer 'safe' or
  worth repairing!A replacement wheelchair will be between $8000.00 and $10,000, his
  indoor lift (for getting from his wheelchair to his bed or shower)
  over $3000, his 18 year old mattress approximately $5000 and his
  rusting 18 year old shower commode around $3000.We are asking for help to raise funds for some of Graham’s expenses -
  in particular - a van - as we all feel his current one is in such
  'unsafe' condition and it is such an essential necessity for Graham!",Janine Metcalfe,https://fundrazr.com/1upT7,0%,$40k,$,120,4,Years running,2,"Kelowna, BC, CA",12,17,3,2
Help Joan through recovery,"My mother, Joan, was on her way to work as a substitue teacher
  Thursday morning when her car slid on the icy roads. As far as we can
  tell, the car spun off the road into a ditch and slammed, driver's
  side door, into a tree. By the time my dad found her about 20 minutes
  later on his way to work, there were many emergency vehicles around
  and they were cutting her out of the car from the passenger side as
  the tree was completely in the drivers seat. She was rushed to the
  hospital with sever head injuries and many broken bones. After cat
  scans and evaluations, we know that she has a fractured scull, pelvis,
  back, neck, and many facial fractures. She has cuts all over her body
  the worst being on her face and head. They still do not know the
  extent of her head/brain injuries, but she has been showing signs of
  improvement and we are hopeful. We are in constant prayer and trust
  and believe Him for complete healing. I have been awed at all the love
  and support that has arisen from family, friends and people I do not
  even know. I am so grateful to you all for your prays, they mean so
  much to our family right now. Many people ask me how they can help and
  ask me to let them know what they can do. I would ask every single
  person who reads this to PLEASE PRAY. Your prayers are by far the most
  important part of my mom's recovery, and I believe that with every
  prayer the enemy's schemes are defeated and the Lord will increase
  healing. Other concerns are minor right now. My parents do have
  insurance that will cover most of the medical expenses, thank the
  Lord. However, my parents have just lost a vehicle and both of their
  incomes. My dad has stopped working to be at mom's bedside full time,
  which is definitely best at this time. And of course my mom will not
  go back to teaching for some time if ever. They have not asked for
  anything, and do not know what I am setting up for them. But I know
  they would be greatly blessed by anything you can give them. Please
  give anything you feel the Lord leads you to give, especially your
  prayers :)",Carrie Borsman,https://fundrazr.com/attj2,,,,,,,,,,,,

  family. I know at this time of year that budgets are tight and we each
  have our own financial difficulties, but remember that if you can't
  spare any money to make a donation, that healing thoughts and prayers
  are free and greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your

30th Birthday Booze Cruise,"As you all know, I am turning old this December. I don't care about birthday presents or a party, but I am planning a 4-day cruise to Mexico at the end of January. I hope you all can come. The cruise departs from Los Angeles on 1/26/14 for Baja, Mexico and will return on 1/29.This will be approximately $250 per person, which includes food. This amount does NOT have to paid up front to book the cruise, you will only need to pay $75 as a deposit, due in August. The remainder is due by November. You may not have $250 today or tomorrow, but if you want to come, RSVP yes and we will figure it out. This will be a mix of two-person staterooms and four-person staterooms. I will add a Paypal link to this page where you can pay your deposit so I can book everything at once.Please respond as quickly as you can and let me know if you are interested. I am working with someone at the cruise line to see about a group rate, but I need a better idea of who would like to go before we can really iron that out.You will obviously need a passport. If you don't have one, you don't need the book, which is expensive, you can get the passport card for $50. Here's more info on that: http://travel.state.gov/passport/I would really love to see all of you on this trip, it's gonna be almost as epic as my dream of banging Jennifer Aniston backstage at a Justin Timberlake concert. Not quite there, but almost as cool. See you in Mexico!",Curt Duncan,https://fundrazr.com/bZZVe,,,,,,,,,,,,
